[CLS] eight years ago , families living in the coastal cha ##m fishing villages of kam ##pot province managed a small coup - they won back fishing rights for the community from the cambodian government .

[SEP] [CLS] the shrimp is dried in a solar dr ##ier which was donated to the community by an international ngo , ensuring it is prepared in an h ##y ##gie ##nic environment , allowing them to charge a higher price . [SEP] [CLS] members of the community are responsible for security , and make regular patrols to ensure there is no illegal logging of the mangrove forest or illegal fishing which could de ##ple ##te stocks .

[SEP] [CLS] this has brought in extra income , built confidence and improved english skills among the community .

[SEP] [CLS] here a young student from the community plants a mangrove as part of the regeneration plan . [SEP] [CLS] here a fisherman prepares for a night fishing trip . [SEP] [CLS] buyers wait for the boats to return . [SEP] [CLS] now the community has more control over the mangrove ##s , they have eliminated third party buyers who were driving the prices down .

[CLS] britain remained firmly opposed to any move towards creating an eu army , sir michael fallon said , as it would simply undermine nato . [SEP] [CLS] and yet it was n ##' ##t on the agenda when eu defence ministers met in slovakia and barely anyone is talking about the idea . [SEP] [CLS] there are no plans for legions of euro ##tro ##ops deck ##ed out in helmets em ##bla ##zone ##d with yellow stars on a blue background . [SEP] [CLS] uk will oppose plan for ` eu army ' [SEP] [CLS] br ##ex ##it vote revive ##s eu army dream [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s difficult , indeed pointless , to oppose something that does n ##' ##t exist and is n ##' ##t being suggested . [SEP] [CLS] but that ' ##s the problem with the argument over the eu ' ##s future military capabilities ; for now it ' ##s a battle of semantics , a war of words . [SEP] [CLS] instead the official agenda here in bratislava spoke of ` ##` the eu global strategy and its syn ##er ##gies and sequencing with the commission ##- ##led ed ##ap ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] but for sir michael fallon there ' ##s already much to dislike . [SEP] [CLS] france and germany presented proposals that would include joint development of military hardware such as helicopters and drones , expanding the eu ' ##s peace ##- ##keeping missions and , most contentious ##ly of all , establishing a permanent joint european military hq . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we will continue to oppose any kind of du ##plication like that , or any unnecessary bureaucracy that cuts across the primary mechanism for defending europe , which is nato , ' ##' mr fallon told reporters . [SEP] [CLS] he was by no means alone in opposing such ` ##` bureau ##cratic du ##plication ' ##' , he said . [SEP] [CLS] germany insists that the idea has nothing to do with a european army . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it is not aimed against nato , ' ##' said defence minister ursula von der ley ##en . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` on the contrary , we need a strong europe and whatever strengthen ##s europe in defence also strengthen ##s nato . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] and those words were under ##lined by nato secretary general jens st ##olt ##enberg , who told reporters at the meeting that there was ` ##` no contradiction between strong european defence and a strong nato ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] the importance lay in avoiding du ##plication , he said . [SEP] [CLS] when he stepped out of the meeting , the uk defence secretary said that 12 countries had spoken and half were against the eu military headquarters , including sweden , the netherlands , poland , latvia and lithuania .

[CLS] and i do n ##' ##t get to say that very often .

[SEP] [CLS] but whereas saturday really is a huge deal for the eu - marking decades of together ##ness at a time when the union is very much under threat from pop ##uli ##st nationalism across the eu , inequality and disco ##rd in the euro ##zone , migration complications and br ##ex ##it itself , of course - next wednesday , while an historic day in the uk , will not play out so big this side of the channel . [SEP] [CLS] there is a determination here that br ##ex ##it must no longer be allowed to dominate and overs ##had ##ow eu politics as it has done since way before the uk referendum even . [SEP] [CLS] one high ##- ##lev ##el source told me that after brussels received britain ' ##s formal notification of its intention to leave , br ##ex ##it would immediately be down ##grade ##d to one of many eu issues to be dealt with , rather than the big thing . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` there will be no major political apocalyptic show , ' ##' he assured me . [SEP] [CLS] but of course , the underlying eu fear remains that if a br ##ex ##it deal is too sweet for the uk , other countries may be inspired to also walk out the door . [SEP] [CLS] brussels officials are grateful that theresa may did not trigger article 50 this week , so close to the eu ' ##s birthday bash . [SEP] [CLS] the tone there will be res ##ol ##ute ##ly upbeat , rather than focused on one of its key members leaving the club . [SEP] [CLS] as for the what ##- ##ha ##ppe ##ns ##- ##ne ##xt with br ##ex ##it , the rule in brussels is : do n ##' ##t expect too much too fast .

[CLS] it was go ##bs ##mack ##ing , unbelievable , en ##th ##ral ##ling and explosive throughout , featuring huge momentum swings and with outstanding individual performances in all three tests . [SEP] [CLS] i thought beforehand that if they lost the first test the lions would lose the series 3 ##- ##0 , so i have to give credit to what is the strongest lions side since 2001 , or maybe even 1997 , for the way they fought back . [SEP] [CLS] the quality shone through both in the players and the coaching . [SEP] [CLS] after the first week or so the debate about lack of preparation time died down - that is one for the administrators to sort out behind closed doors . [SEP] [CLS] but just think what they could have done with 10 days ' more time to get ready - they might even have gone in as favourites against the world champions . [SEP] [CLS] this will be a tour remembered for sean o ##' ##bri ##en ' ##s try in the first test . [SEP] [CLS] the lions may have lost that match but it was a wonder try , and now the lads have managed to draw the series that score will be the one that sticks in the memory . [SEP] [CLS] although that might be the stand ##out moment , to be honest pretty much every moment of every test was a defining moment - it really was that good . [SEP] [CLS] the most significant moment was sonny bill williams ' red card in the second test . [SEP] [CLS] you do n ##' ##t know for certain what the outcome would have been had he not been sent off , but it ' ##s more than likely new zealand would have won . [SEP] [CLS] that was effectively two defining moments - the impact of his shoulder with anthony watson ' ##s head , and the moment referee jerome ga ##rce ##s - correctly - decided it was a red ##- ##card offence . [SEP] [CLS] it was a huge momentum swing in both the match and the series , although it did n ##' ##t seem so immediately because the lions proceeded to give away loads of penalties and slip nine points behind , before finally starting to believe in themselves and scoring two great tries as they fought back to win . [SEP] [CLS] another pivotal moment would have been conversations after the first test because the lions had been dominated physically in many cases .

[SEP] [CLS] the game went viral after being promoted almost entirely by social media users and was reviewed on a youtube channel by more than 22 million subscribers .

[CLS] they have injected human stem cells into pig embryo ##s to produce human ##- ##pi ##g embryo ##s known as chi ##mer ##as . [SEP] [CLS] the embryo ##s are part of research aimed at overcoming the worldwide shortage of transplant organs . [SEP] [CLS] the team from university of california , davis says they should look and behave like normal pigs except that one organ will be composed of human cells .

[SEP] [CLS] the bbc ' ##s panorama was given access to the research for medicine ' ##s big breakthrough : editing your genes . [SEP] [CLS] creating the chi ##meric embryo ##s takes two stages . [SEP] [CLS] first , a technique known as crisp ##r gene editing is used to remove dna from a newly fe ##rti ##lis ##ed pig embryo that would enable the resulting foe ##tus to grow a pan ##cre ##as . [SEP] [CLS] this creates a genetic ` ##` niche ' ##' or void . [SEP] [CLS] then , human induced pl ##uri ##pot ##ent - ##lr ##b ##- ip ##s - ##rr ##b ##- stem cells are injected into the embryo .

' ##' [SEP] [CLS] but the work is controversial . [SEP] [CLS] last year , the main us medical research agency , the national institutes of health , imposed a mora ##torium on funding such experiments . [SEP] [CLS] the main concern is that the human cells might migrate to the developing pig ' ##s brain and make it , in some way , more human . [SEP] [CLS] pablo ross says this is unlikely but is a key reason why the research is proceeding with such caution : ` ##` we think there is very low potential for a human brain to grow , but this is something we will be investigating .

[CLS] the response from many in that time has been : ` ##` let ' ##s get on with it .

[SEP] [CLS] my sense is that the public will be flexible on the timing up to a point , as long as they are given a clear sense of direction .

[SEP] [CLS] in stark contrast , those that supported leaving feel vin ##dicated by their campaign , and now believe they are the ones in touch with vast swat ##hes of the population . [SEP] [CLS] the referendum result was a devastating indictment of the effectiveness of the billions of pounds of eu funds spent trying to reg ##ener ##ate economically deprived communities . [SEP] [CLS] the brutal reality is that those who were most likely to vote to leave lived in communities where most eu money had been spent . [SEP] [CLS] it is an extraordinary paradox that raised eyebrows far further afi ##eld than wales . [SEP] [CLS] the early stages of a debate about replacement funding has got under way . [SEP] [CLS] the welsh secretary al ##un cairns , a remain campaign ##er , led the way by wasting no time in calling for a fundamental change in approach . [SEP] [CLS] br ##ex ##it means the wales office may have been given a new sense of purpose , and no more so than in regeneration funding . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s been little meat on the bone but his fundamental premise is that everything has to change , and simply writing a westminster che ##que rather than a brussels che ##que will not cut it . [SEP] [CLS] the early signs are that the wales office would like to play a part redesign ##ing a new funding system . [SEP] [CLS] this will not go down well with the welsh government but the come ##- ##back from westminster will be that officials in cardiff have not done a good job spending the money .

[CLS] traditionally it ' ##s always been much less good at keeping secrets . [SEP] [CLS] journalists have a natural inclination toward gossip . [SEP] [CLS] so , it was highly unusual that bbc bosses had managed to keep the launch of a whole new bbc scotland channel entirely secret until it was announced to staff on wednesday morning . [SEP] [CLS] staff , viewers and politicians were expecting to be told that plans for a ` ##` scottish six ' ##' had been she ##lved . [SEP] [CLS] no one knew that there would be an hour ##- ##long news programme with scottish , uk and world news at 9 ##pm instead . [SEP] [CLS] already there has been a widespread welcome for the idea of a new channel , new programmes and most importantly new money to make those programmes .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` ed woodward has my list , ' ##' the portuguese manager said after his side beat ajax to win the europa league for the first time on wednesday . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` now it ' ##s up to him and the owners .

[SEP] [CLS] since then , a major stumbling block has been removed by united securing the return of champions league football . [SEP] [CLS] they will go straight into the group stage after their victory over ajax in stockholm . [SEP] [CLS] gr ##ie ##zman ##n has the pace and trick ##ery united lack but , should a move fa ##lter , torino forward andrea bel ##otti is another option . [SEP] [CLS] the 23 ##- ##year ##- ##old italy international has scored 25 goals in serie a this season . [SEP] [CLS] keane , meanwhile , left united for burnley in january 2015 but mo ##uri ##nh ##o is known to be eager to bring the 24 ##- ##year ##- ##old defender back to old trafford . [SEP] [CLS] the portuguese views predecessor louis van gaa ##l ' ##s decision to sell the centre ##- ##back for # 2 ##m as a mistake and believes his central defensive options are limited . [SEP] [CLS] in theory , a 25 % sell ##- ##on clause agreed at the time of that deal should bring the price down . [SEP] [CLS] however , burnley manager sean d ##ych ##e has said the clare ##ts have no financial need to sell keane , who made his england debut in march . [SEP] [CLS] prior to the january transfer window , united showed interest in benfica ' ##s sweden centre ##- ##back victor lin ##del ##of , 22 , while left ##- ##back is another area of weakness .

[CLS] the initial plan was to pass ownership to supporters ' group well society in five years , but instead it has taken 14 months for the hand ##over to be agreed .

[SEP] [CLS] for him , a lana ##rks ##hire boy whose business career took him abroad and eventually into a life of significant wealth , the point was to contribute to his local community . [SEP] [CLS] challenges remain , though , even if hut ##chison believes much of the hard work has been carried out . [SEP] [CLS] the significant progress is that costs have been cut , that investments have been made on infrastructure projects at fir park and on improving the chances of the football side of the business contributing to self ##- ##sus ##tain ##ability . [SEP] [CLS] hut ##chison is satisfied that in agreeing to sell his 76 % share ##holding for # 1 to the well society , he has paved the way for stability and fan ownership . [SEP] [CLS] if there is a message from hut ##chison , it is that fans and local businesses need to step up to support the club financially , so that it never needs to be re ##lian ##t on wealthy individuals or investors . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i ca n ##' ##t speak to the future of any business , whether it ' ##s secure or otherwise , but if they have enough customers and they follow the strategy which has been implemented , we ' ##ve significantly improved the probability of success , ' ##' hut ##chison told bbc scotland from his home in barbados .

[SEP] [CLS] low interest rates , combined with growth in the job market and wage increases , have bo ##lster ##ed the us housing market , but fears of slowing global growth could damp ##en confidence this year .

[CLS] speaking to radio times magazine , pa ##x ##man , 63 , said : ` ##` if a cha ##p ca n ##' ##t shave on holiday , what can he do ? [SEP] [CLS] beard ##s are so 2013 . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] pa ##x ##man un ##int ##ent ##ional ##ly created a media storm when he fronted news ##night with a full beard on bbc two last august . [SEP] [CLS] at the time , he branded the bbc ` ##` po ##gon ##op ##ho ##bic ' ##' - which means having a fear of beard ##s . [SEP] [CLS] he also explained his reasons , saying : ` ##` i have grown a beard for the last few summers , and suddenly wondered whether i really needed to shave it off to present news ##night . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` unless you ' ##re lucky enough to be uncle albert on only fools and horses , demi ##s ro ##uss ##os or abu ham ##za , the bbc is generally as po ##gon ##op ##ho ##bic as the late ##- ##lam ##ented albanian dictator , en ##ver ho ##x ##ha .

[SEP] [CLS] for all of ga ##zza ' ##s amazing moments on the pitch , he ' ##s also known for his long term battle with alcohol . [SEP] [CLS] despite visible signs of vulnerability over the years the former footballer seemed back to his old ` ##` da ##ft as a brush ' ##' self . [SEP] [CLS] paul gas ##co ##ign ##e was massive news when you were growing up . [SEP] [CLS] he picked up 57 england caps and was described as the most naturally gifted footballer of his generation . [SEP] [CLS] type ` ##` paul gas ##co ##ign ##e euro 96 wonder goal ' ##' in your search engine and you ' ##ll see for yourself . [SEP] [CLS] he was also famed for cracking jokes and playing prank ##s on teammates . [SEP] [CLS] he began the interview talking about how the tabloid ##s have reported on his problems with addiction . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] - ##lr ##b ##- what - ##rr ##b ##- the press what they ' ##ve been writing about it , it ' ##s scandal ##ous . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the press were actually outside my house and were taking pictures and they even wrote the next day that i was in rehab in spain somewhere , ' ##' he said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i was n ##' ##t , i was somewhere else . [SEP] [CLS] it was just the lies that keeps coming on . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] he then remembered a conversation which led to him signing for tottenham .

[SEP] [CLS] in response , the us and south korean military conducted a live ##- ##fi ##ring exercise using surface ##- ##to ##- ##sur ##face missiles , a us defence official said . [SEP] [CLS] the missiles were fired into the ` ##` territorial waters of south korea along the east coast , ' ##' a us military statement said . [SEP] [CLS] the latest north korean missile flew higher , further and for longer than the one in early july . [SEP] [CLS] its launch has been condemned by a number of countries . [SEP] [CLS] the test - the 14th carried out by north korea in 2017 - is the latest to be conducted in defiance of a un ban . [SEP] [CLS] us president donald trump called it ` ##` only the latest reckless and dangerous action by the north korean regime ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] jeffrey lewis , a nuclear non ##pro ##life ##ration expert at the middle ##bury institute of international studies in california , said that initial indications showed the latest missile had a range of about 10 ##, ##00 ##0 km - far enough to strike the west coast of the united states and beyond . [SEP] [CLS] the washington post reported that denver and possibly chicago could now be in north korea ' ##s range .

[SEP] [CLS] it is unusual for north korea to launch a missile at night - the significance is as yet unclear . [SEP] [CLS] no missiles had been fired from ja ##gang province before , indicating a previously ##- ##unk ##now ##n launch site is operational . [SEP] [CLS] japanese chief cabinet secretary yo ##shi ##hide su ##ga said the missile flew for about 45 minutes - some six minutes longer than the ic ##bm tested in early july . [SEP] [CLS] nh ##k said it reached an altitude of about 3 ##, ##00 ##0 km - about 200 ##km higher than the previous ic ##bm . [SEP] [CLS] it landed about 1 ##, ##00 ##0 km from the launch site , the pentagon said . [SEP] [CLS] ic ##bm ##s can reach altitudes well outside the earth ' ##s atmosphere .

[CLS] the announcement follows a series of drone crashes that made the company recall its much anticipated karma aircraft . [SEP] [CLS] in addition , the us company said its president , anthony bates , would quit his post at the end of the year after three years in the job . [SEP] [CLS] go ##pro said that consumer demand for its products remained ` ##` solid ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] however , the company has posted a loss in each of its past four quarters . [SEP] [CLS] at the start of this month it also revealed its cash reserves had fallen to $ 132 ##m - ##lr ##b ##- [UNK] # 106 ##m - ##rr ##b ##- - less than half the amount at the start of the year . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i knew they were in trouble , but i did n ##' ##t expect them to have such a dramatic fall from grace , ' ##' tom mor ##rod , director of consumer electronics at the i ##hs consultancy , told the bbc . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the karma drones were their recover strategy , and when they had to be recalled it faltered . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` go ##pro was struggling as an action cam specialist , which is why it needed an alternative market . [SEP] [CLS] the fact that the device was un ##sal ##able has damaged its prospects , at least temporarily . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the job cuts represent 15 % of the california ##- ##base ##d company ' ##s workforce . [SEP] [CLS] the move reflects the fact that even if the fold ##- ##up karma drone returns to sale , go ##pro will probably have missed out on the christmas shopping season . [SEP] [CLS] it had sold about 2 ##, ##500 of the drones in the 16 days they were on the market . [SEP] [CLS] a problem with the machines caused a number of them to lose power mid ##- ##flight , causing them to fall un ##con ##tro ##lled out of the air . [SEP] [CLS] one video of an accident showed the drone diving on to a beach on which people were walking . [SEP] [CLS] there have been no reports of injuries . [SEP] [CLS] however , the company is being sued over claims it mis ##led investors about demand for the product and took too long to alert the public to its power supply flaw . [SEP] [CLS] reviews for go ##pro ' ##s new hero 5 cameras have generally been positive . [SEP] [CLS] the new devices introduced voice control , electronic image stab ##ilis ##ation and built ##- ##in water resistance .

[CLS] but many of the people using the health service in england or northern ireland on monday morning may not have noticed a huge difference . [SEP] [CLS] walk ##outs in the nhs are quite different from other sectors . [SEP] [CLS] when tube drivers , council staff or teachers strike the aim is to cause disruption . [SEP] [CLS] it is the first rule of industrial action : make your contribution count . [SEP] [CLS] however , the terms of engagement are somewhat different when nhs workers take part . [SEP] [CLS] while unions members want to make a point , they commit to not harm ##ing urgent and emergency services . [SEP] [CLS] ahead of this week ' ##s action local union officials held talks with managers to plan services - as they did before the walk ##out on 17 october . [SEP] [CLS] it means there are likely to have been many staff in work who supported the strike but have agreed to keep working . [SEP] [CLS] mid ##wives are a classic example of this . [SEP] [CLS] the royal college of mid ##wives has promised to keep maternity units running and so well over half of their members are believed to have worked . [SEP] [CLS] and even where staff have walked out , there appears to have been a willingness to leave the picket lines when there has been a need . [SEP] [CLS] in a word , pay . [SEP] [CLS] ministers in england and northern ireland have awarded nhs staff a 1 % increase , but only for those without automatic progression ##- ##in ##- ##the ##- ##jo ##b rises . [SEP] [CLS] these , designed to reward professional development , are given to about half of staff and are worth 3 % a year on average . [SEP] [CLS] what is more , the offer is ` ##` non ##- ##con ##sol ##ida ##ted ' ##' , which means it is taken away at the end of the year , meaning their pay packet returns back to the 2013 ##- ##14 level , and does not count towards staff pensions . [SEP] [CLS] an independent pay review board had said the 1 % increase should be across the board and paid in full as normal . [SEP] [CLS] next year it has been suggested those not getting a progression ##- ##in ##- ##the job rise get 2 % , but again it should be non ##- ##con ##sol ##ida ##ted . [SEP] [CLS] but in scotland a 1 % pay rise was given to everyone and in wales a deal was reached last week after ministers agreed to pay 1 % next year , while giving extra help to the lowest paid this year . [SEP] [CLS] it means the disruption during both strikes seems to have been limited to areas such as out ##patient appointments and community clinics . [SEP] [CLS] and it is why unions are able to claim
[CLS] gerard kevin hughes , 29 , and gavin martin hughes , 31 , who are both from springfield park in belfast , appeared in court alongside their older brother joseph christopher hughes , 35 , from the meadows in down ##pa ##trick . [SEP] [CLS] the trio all appeared at belfast crown court . [SEP] [CLS] the charges arose from incidents in 2013 . [SEP] [CLS] the court hearing was told that on 9 october , 2013 , a car driven by gavin hughes was stopped in north belfast , and when the vehicle was stopped a black plastic bag was located on the passenger seat . [SEP] [CLS] the bag contained five compact cube ##s of cocaine which amounted to 1 ##. ##27 ki ##los of the class a drug . [SEP] [CLS] when gavin hughes was searched , another amount of cocaine was found in the pockets of his jeans , and he was taken into custody . [SEP] [CLS] the following day , officers travelled to an address in the li ##gon ##iel area of the city , which at the time was being rented by gavin hughes . [SEP] [CLS] when they arrived , police found gavin ' ##s two brothers gareth and joseph at the property . [SEP] [CLS] both the property and a vehicle parked outside the house were searched , and further packages of cocaine were seized , alongside items and equipment associated with mixing drugs . [SEP] [CLS] also located during the search were 21 ecstasy tablets . [SEP] [CLS] the court heard it was the crown ' ##s case that the rented property was being used to mix the cocaine and prepare it for sale . [SEP] [CLS] the total amount of cocaine seized on 9 and 10 october 2013 amounted to 3 ##. ##25 ki ##los . [SEP] [CLS] the hughes brothers subsequently pleaded guilty to a number of drugs offences , while gerard hughes also admitted two further offences - namely possession of cannabis with intent to supply , and possession of amp ##het ##amine on 6 august , 2013 . [SEP] [CLS] these offences were linked to the seizure of drugs in a car park in east belfast . [SEP] [CLS] regarding the drugs seizures in october 2013 , gavin hughes pleaded guilty to five charges , including possessing cocaine with intent to supply . [SEP] [CLS] he was handed a four ##- ##year sentence and was told he will serve a year in prison , with the remaining three years on licence upon his release . [SEP] [CLS] his brother gerard - who appeared on charges arising from two separate incidents in august and october 2013 - was handed a sentence of five years . [SEP] [CLS] half of this sentence will be spent in jail , with the remaining two years and six months on licence when he is released from prison .

[CLS] it ' ##s a type of battery called lithium ##- ##sul ##ph ##ur , which - in theory - could have five times the energy density of the lithium ##- ##ion forms in wide use today . [SEP] [CLS] but the prototype developed by a uk ##- ##chin ##ese team overcome ##s a key hurdle to their commercial development by taking inspiration from the gut . [SEP] [CLS] details appear in the journal advanced functional materials . [SEP] [CLS] scientists are tack ##ling the challenge of improving battery technology using a variety of different approaches ; this is one of them . [SEP] [CLS] one of the problems hind ##ering the commercial development of lithium ##- ##sul ##ph ##ur ##- ##base ##d devices has been the degradation of the batteries caused by the loss of active materials within . [SEP] [CLS] to overcome this problem , the researchers developed a lightweight layer with nano ##- ##sca ##le structure which resembles the vi ##lli - finger ##- ##like pro ##tr ##usions which line the small int ##est ##ine . [SEP] [CLS] in humans , vi ##lli are used to absorb the products of digest ##ion and increase the surface area across which this process can take place . [SEP] [CLS] in the new lithium ##- ##sul ##ph ##ur battery , a layer of material with a vi ##lli ##- ##like structure , made from tiny zinc oxide wires , is placed on the surface of one of the battery ' ##s electrode ##s . [SEP] [CLS] this can trap fragments of the active material when they break off , keeping them accessible for ongoing reactions and allowing the material to be reused . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it ' ##s a tiny thing , this layer , but it ' ##s important , ' ##' said study co ##- ##au ##thor dr paul cox ##on from the university of cambridge ' ##s department of materials science and metal ##lu ##rgy . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` this gets us a long way through the bottle ##neck which is preventing the development of better batteries . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the researchers say that , if hurdles to commercial development can be overcome , lithium ##- ##sul ##ph ##ur batteries could have five times the energy density of the lithium ##- ##ion batteries used in smartphone ##s and other electronics . [SEP] [CLS] but as lithium ##- ##sul ##ph ##ur batteries discharge , sul ##ph ##ur molecules transform into chain ##- ##like structures known as poly ##- ##sul ##phi ##des . [SEP] [CLS] as the devices undergo several charge ##- ##dis ##cha ##rge cycles , bits of the poly ##- ##sul ##phi ##de go into the battery ' ##s electro ##ly ##te - ##lr ##b ##- the electrically ##- ##con ##du ##cting solution - ##rr ##b ##- , so that over time the battery loses active material .

[SEP] [CLS] mysterious pictures online of a clown and a bala ##cl ##ava ##- ##wear ##ing sidekick have caused a stir in the town . [SEP] [CLS] the police appeal caused a backlash on social media from some people who felt they were cracking down on fun . [SEP] [CLS] police said they started an investigation after receiving reports from parents that their children were frightened of the clown . [SEP] [CLS] a police officer wrote on the ps ##ni newtown ##ab ##bey and carr ##ick ##fer ##gus facebook page : ` ##` fun is fun but frightening school pupils is another . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the mystery man , who calls himself the carr ##ick ` ##` killer clown ' ##' , contacted the police following the appeal to ap ##olo ##gis ##e for any distress . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` he assure ##s me that this was a prank and it was not his intention in any way to fright ##en the school pupils or cause distress , ' ##' the officer wrote .

[CLS] michael d higgins will ask the council of state if the protection of life during pregnancy bill ' ##s legal ##ity should be tested by the supreme court . [SEP] [CLS] the bill would allow a termination when doctors dee ##m that a woman is at risk of taking her life . [SEP] [CLS] president higgins must decide by wednesday whether to sign the bill into law or refer it to the court . [SEP] [CLS] if the supreme court decides it is constitutional and approve ##s the bill , it will automatically become law and its constitutional ##ity could never be subsequently challenged . [SEP] [CLS] it the first time that president higgins has convened the council of state since he assumed office in november 2011 . [SEP] [CLS] the council of state is an advisory body that aids and counsel ##s the president . [SEP] [CLS] the introduction of the legislation follows the case of an indian woman who died in an irish hospital after she was refused an abortion . [SEP] [CLS] the debate revealed deep splits in the predominantly catholic country . [SEP] [CLS] anti ##- ##ab ##ort ##ion campaign ##ers say that the bill will allow the intentional killing of the un ##born for the first time in the republic of ireland . [SEP] [CLS] others argue the bill is too limited as it does not allow for termination ##s in cases of rape or inc ##est , or when there is a foe ##tal abnormal ##ity or when the foe ##tus can not survive outside the womb . [SEP] [CLS] since a supreme court ruling in the 1992 x case , abortion has been constitutional ##ly available when a woman ' ##s life , as distinct from her health , is at risk from the continued pregnancy . [SEP] [CLS] x was a suicidal 14 ##- ##year ##- ##old school ##girl who had been raped by a neighbour and was initially prevented from leaving the country for an abortion in britain . [SEP] [CLS] since then , the credible threat of suicide is , constitutional ##ly , regarded as grounds for a termination . [SEP] [CLS] but until now , no government in the republic has introduced legislation to give doctors legal certainty on when an abortion can be carried out . [SEP] [CLS] that uncertainty provided part of the context for the sa ##vita hal ##app ##ana ##var case . [SEP] [CLS] she was a 31 ##- ##year ##- ##old indian dentist who was admitted to hospital in galway in october 2012 while mis ##car ##ry ##ing . [SEP] [CLS] she died a week later from sept ##ica ##emia . [SEP] [CLS] her request for an abortion was turned down . [SEP] [CLS] her in ##quest heard that she could not get a termination at the time because her life was not in danger but , by the time her life was at risk , an abortion would have been too late
[CLS] mr turnbull said the titles were ` ##` not appropriate ' ##' in modern australia , and that queen elizabeth had accepted the cabinet ' ##s recommendation to drop them . [SEP] [CLS] former pm tony abbott reintroduced knight ##hood ##s and dame ##hood ##s in 2014 . [SEP] [CLS] his controversial decision to grant prince philip a knight ##hood in january was widely seen as one of the factors which ended his term as leader . [SEP] [CLS] mr abbott at the time said australia was honour ##ing the duke of edinburgh ' ##s lifetime of ` ##` service and dedication ' ##' , but later said the decision was ` ##` in ##ju ##dic ##ious ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] he was ousted as leader of the centre ##- ##right liberal party by mr turnbull in september . [SEP] [CLS] analysis : jon don ##nis ##on , bbc news , sydney [SEP] [CLS] the decision to give prince philip a knight ##hood was hugely unpopular in australia and seen as one of the biggest blu ##nder ##s of tony abbott ' ##s brief time in office . [SEP] [CLS] now the new prime minister malcolm turnbull , who in 1999 led australia ' ##s unsuccessful campaign to abandon the monarchy and become a republic , has dropped knights and dame ##s . [SEP] [CLS] the prime minister will have the chance to discuss the matter with the duke of edinburgh ' ##s son later this month , when prince charles comes to australia on a royal visit . [SEP] [CLS] mr turnbull has recently said he remains a republican but says he does not regard the issue as a priority for his government . [SEP] [CLS] end of ` knight ##mare ' poses republican question [SEP] [CLS] in a statement , mr turnbull said the order of australia awards were ` ##` an important way of honour ##ing the achievements and service of many australians , including those un ##sun ##g heroes who might not otherwise be recognised outside their local communities ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] but he said his cabinet had recently reviewed the system and decided that the knight ##hood ##s and dame ##hood ##s were ` ##` not appropriate in our modern honours system ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] existing knights and dame ##s would not be affected by the change , he said . [SEP] [CLS] the opposition labor party welcomed the move , with shadow treasurer chris bowen describing the titles ` ##` a national disgrace ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] but he said it was ` ##` not appropriate ' ##' for australia to be ` ##` clinging onto imperial britain through our honours system ' ##' .

[SEP] [CLS] until his marathon effort at new ##lands , am ##la , a veteran of 90 tests and 7 ##, ##10 ##8 runs , had not hit a test century since december 2014 . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i honestly feel a lot of the criticism that hash ##im has faced in the last couple of weeks is very harsh , ' ##' said south africa coach russell domingo . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` he is one of south africa ' ##s greatest players . [SEP] [CLS] there has n ##' ##t been enough respect shown of his achievements as a player . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] de villiers had raised doubts about his future in test cricket during the first test because of his busy work ##load , and handed over wicket ##keeping duties to qui ##nton de ko ##ck for the second match . [SEP] [CLS] the 31 ##- ##year ##- ##old , who already leads the one ##- ##day side , said : ` ##` it is an incredible honour to captain south africa in any format .

[CLS] the liberal democrat chief secretary to the treasury aims to introduce a new offence for firms that fail to act to prevent economic crime . [SEP] [CLS] mr alexander told the andrew mar ##r show he wants organisations that encourage or facilitate tax eva ##sion to face the same penalties as evade ##rs themselves . [SEP] [CLS] the proposed crack ##down comes in the wake of hs ##bc tax ##- ##do ##d ##ging allegations . [SEP] [CLS] it emerged earlier this month that the bank had allegedly helped hundreds of people evade uk tax using hidden hs ##bc accounts in geneva . [SEP] [CLS] former director of public prosecution ##s lord ken macdonald said the bank had left itself open to criminal charges in the uk and there were strong grounds to investigate the bank for ` ##` cheating ' ##' hm revenue and customs .

' ##' [SEP] [CLS] he described it as a ` ##` liberal democrat idea ' ##' but intends to try to push the proposals through before may ' ##s general election . [SEP] [CLS] if he can not , they will form a key part of the li ##b dem manifesto .

[SEP] [CLS] those with deposits between 20 ##, ##00 ##0 and 100 ##, ##00 ##0 would pay a one ##- ##off levy of 6 ##. ##75 % . [SEP] [CLS] savings above 100 ##, ##00 ##0 would face a 9 ##. ##9 % tax . [SEP] [CLS] the proposal leaves in doubt whether it could raise the nearly 6 ##bn euros that was a central part of the bail ##out deal . [SEP] [CLS] and in a further indication of just how complicated this could become , the cypriot central bank governor panic ##os dem ##et ##ria ##des said he expected that 10 % of deposits would be withdrawn when banks finally open . [SEP] [CLS] the cypriot government appears to have decided against raising the levy on those with deposits of more than 100 ##, ##00 ##0 euros to over 15 % . [SEP] [CLS] here ' ##s the rub : the government fears this would effectively destroy its financial sector . [SEP] [CLS] those wealthy russians , who are the largest foreign investors , are likely to pull their funds out of the island if the one ##- ##off tax is too high . [SEP] [CLS] the russians are angry and the cypriot finance minister is heading to moscow to explain . [SEP] [CLS] the cypriot ##s argue that the bail ##out would end up under ##mini ##ng a key sector of the economy . [SEP] [CLS] the suspicion in nico ##sia is that it is precisely what countries like germany want . [SEP] [CLS] they do n ##' ##t
[CLS] the event was organised by trade unionist ##s , councillors , labour party members , and ms ##ps . [SEP] [CLS] they are calling for action by the scottish and uk governments to protect the industry and its jobs . [SEP] [CLS] about 400 marche ##rs set off at 11 ##: ##00 from the dal ##zell works , heading to ravens ##cr ##ai ##g for a rally . [SEP] [CLS] up to 270 jobs could be lost after tata steel announced plans to moth ##ball the plants along with 900 posts at the firm ' ##s facility in sc ##unt ##horpe . [SEP] [CLS] a total of 225 jobs are threatened at the dal ##zell plate ##- ##roll ##ing works in mother ##well , along with 45 posts at the clyde ##bridge plant in cam ##bus ##lang . [SEP] [CLS] the company blame ##s cheap chinese imports and high energy costs for a collapse in steel prices . [SEP] [CLS] the scottish government has assembled a task ##force to try to guarantee a future for the plants . [SEP] [CLS] community union representative derek fear ##on said : ` ##` we are trying to raise awareness of the campaign , and hopefully through this tata will become a responsible seller . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the main aim of the task ##force , the priority of it , is for the two plants to remain open . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the mood is upbeat , the guys are still positive that everything can be done for the two plants to be saved . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the scottish government has pledged to do everything possible to keep the plants operational , with its preferred option being to find a buyer . [SEP] [CLS] however , ministers have not ruled out moves to bring both facilities under public ownership . [SEP] [CLS] a scottish steel task force , chaired by business minister fergus ewing , and including representatives from trade unions and tata , as well as local councils , met last week to discuss the way forward . [SEP] [CLS] mother ##well and wish ##aw ms ##p john pen ##tland , himself a former steel ##work ##er , has welcomed the creation of the task force and called for all avenues to be explored to keep the plants open . [SEP] [CLS] he said : ` ##` the starting point for the scottish task force should be saving the steel plants and all the jobs , not soft ##ening the blow . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we should not meek ##ly accept the ann ##ih ##ilation of the scottish steel industry . [SEP] [CLS] we do n ##' ##t want consolation measures such as re ##train ##ing for other jobs that do n ##' ##t exist . [SEP] [CLS] there are other options that will protect the industry and its jobs . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i believe scottish steel can have a future , and we
[CLS] he said it ` ##` makes sense ' ##' for pay to be handled by am ##s and welsh ministers as education is already dev ##olved . [SEP] [CLS] the welsh government described the move - part of planned changes to the wales bill which sets out the next steps for welsh dev ##ol ##ution - as ` ##` encouraging ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] but two major teaching unions say they are opposed to the idea , fearing lower pay than in england . [SEP] [CLS] the move is one of several improvements demanded by first minister car ##wyn jones for the bill , which the welsh government says it is not yet ready to support . [SEP] [CLS] the announcement was made as the much ##- ##cr ##itic ##ised bill , which makes significant changes to the way power is shared between wales and westminster , returned to the house of lords for debate on monday . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` education is a dev ##olved matter , and it makes sense for the assembly and welsh ministers to decide the pay and conditions of teachers ' in wales , ' ##' mr cairns said . [SEP] [CLS] the amendment to the bill on teachers ' pay will be debated next monday . [SEP] [CLS] powers over the community infrastructure levy - which allows councils to raise cash for local improvements - will also be dev ##olved , mr cairns added , with further changes promised in the coming weeks . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i want a clear and lasting dev ##ol ##ution settlement that works for wales and for the uk as a whole , ' ##' he said , adding he was happy to consider dev ##ol ##ving further powers ` ##` where there ' ##s a clear purpose for doing so ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] however ge ##rain ##t davies , wales official for the nas ##uw ##t union , said teachers in wales were ` ##` best served by a continuous link with westminster ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] he said : ` ##` we strongly believe that if pay and conditions were dev ##olved there is every danger that teachers here could end up being paid less than across the border for doing the same job . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] mr davies added if wages were higher in england there was also a risk of teachers leaving wales to further their careers . [SEP] [CLS] owen hat ##hwa ##y , policy officer for nut cy ##m ##ru , also said his members were opposed to the move . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we are fearful that we will have terms and conditions that are depressed and will lead to lower wages , ' ##' he said .

[CLS] some australian states already have ` ##` no ja ##b , no play ' ##' laws , but pm malcolm turnbull is calling for nationwide legislation . [SEP] [CLS] health groups have supported the push , arguing parents and the community have an obligation to protect children . [SEP] [CLS] an australian child health poll survey of nearly 2 ##, ##00 ##0 parents showed 5 % of children were not fully va ##cci ##nated . [SEP] [CLS] mr turnbull said more needed to be done , citing the case of a baby who died from who ##oping cough .

[SEP] [CLS] vaccines can cause adverse reactions in a small number of people , like many medicines , but the accepted science is that the benefits far out ##weig ##h the risks . [SEP] [CLS] widespread va ##cci ##nation also reduces the risk of infection to those who , for medical reasons , may not be able to receive the vaccine themselves . [SEP] [CLS] so ##- ##cal ##led ` ##` herd immunity ' ##' is an important part of public health programmes .

[SEP] [CLS] they asked gb taekwondo to rec ##ons ##ider their choice of lu ##tal ##o muhammad and the governing body returned with the same name , and , satisfied that proper selection procedures had been followed , the bo ##a did n ##' ##t have much choice .

[SEP] [CLS] the church joins several uk institutions that have already signed up to the movement , including glasgow university and the british medical association .

[SEP] [CLS] the church of england says it will withdraw investments worth # 12 ##m from companies that make money from extract ##ing thermal coal - used in generating electricity - or producing oil from tar sands . [SEP] [CLS] this is but a fraction of its total investment portfolio and some are already calling for the church to go further by dive ##sti ##ng from all fossil fuels .

[CLS] he spoke after a crisis meeting in brussels about the global steel g ##lu ##t that was attended by 30 countries .

[SEP] [CLS] however , china rejected suggestions that it sub ##si ##dis ##ed its loss ##- ##making steel companies , and the meeting ended without any formal agreement . [SEP] [CLS] nevertheless , mr ja ##vid said china is ` ##` committing to do something about it and i think that ' ##s a very positive step forward ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] he said it was the first time all the major steel ##- ##pro ##du ##cing nations had come together with the industry to discuss the issue of excess capacity . [SEP] [CLS] mr ja ##vid admitted that there was no ` ##` overnight solution ' ##' to the issue of excess production : ` ##` the discussion today with all these countries coming together is something that we pushed for , and ... china ' ##s participation will help make the difference . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] chinese steel output rose in march , according to official figures released last week , despite repeated pledge ##s to cut capacity . [SEP] [CLS] ministers and trade officials , including from the us and india , as well as the world trade organisation , world steel association and the private sector attended monday ' ##s meeting , which was organised by the o ##ec ##d . [SEP] [CLS] mari ki ##vin ##ie ##mi , o ##ec ##d deputy secretary ##- ##gen ##eral , said there was ` ##` very strong willingness ' ##' to hold further talks , with some countries wanting to take more ` ##` concrete steps ' ##' .

[SEP] [CLS] this is a global problem which requires a global solution to remove current over ##- ##cap ##ac ##ity and time is a luxury we do n ##' ##t have . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] he called on china to take the same radical action that european steel producers had embraced . [SEP] [CLS] earlier , china ' ##s official news agency said that blaming the country for the global steel industry ' ##s problems was a ` ##` lame and lazy excuse for protection ##ism ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] xi ##nh ##ua said in an english ##- ##lang ##ua ##ge commentary piece : ` ##` blaming other countries is always an easy , sure ##- ##fire way for politicians to whip up a storm over domestic economic wo ##es , but finger ##- ##point ##ing and protection ##ism are counter ##- ##pro ##ductive .

[CLS] well the first part of it , that there are no commitments in the manifesto that require additional borrowing , is binding up until may 7 - in the sense that labour is not offering good ##ies to voters without saying what services or benefits will be cut or which taxes will be increased to pay for those good ##ies . [SEP] [CLS] ed mil ##iba ##nd was at pains to contrast this put ##ative pr ##udence with tori ##es ' promise to increase nhs spending by # 8 ##bn or their pledge to increase the 40 % tax threshold and the tax ##- ##free threshold - which would also cost around # 8 ##bn - without saying where the # 16 ##bn odd would come from . [SEP] [CLS] so in that sense labour has subjected itself to discipline which the tori ##es have decided they do n ##' ##t need - ##lr ##b ##- largely because they think voters will give them the benefit of the doubt , based on the cuts they ' ##ve delivered in the current parliament - ##rr ##b ##- . [SEP] [CLS] but to state the bloom ##in ' obvious , this first element in the lock can only keep labour fiscal ##ly honest until the election . [SEP] [CLS] after that , and if in power , they could in theory launch on a grateful or un ##grate ##ful nation any number of initiatives that would not be funded by tax rises or com ##men ##sur ##ate spending cuts . [SEP] [CLS] so ed mil ##iba ##nd has for ##sw ##orn offering us una ##ff ##ord ##able bribes to get elected . [SEP] [CLS] but it is the other parts of the lock that would be important to keep a labour government - if such arrives after may 7 - fiscal ##ly constrained - ##lr ##b ##- which may or may not be a good thing , by the way - ##rr ##b ##- . [SEP] [CLS] well again the first one - that the deficit will be cut every year - would on current forecast ##s for economic growth allow quite a bit of additional spending : the overall deficit would still fall as a share of gdp so long as overall spending increased marginal ##ly slower than gdp , all else being equal ; and it would also fall in absolute terms so long as economic growth generated an inc ##rem ##ent to tax revenues marginal ##ly greater than the spending inc ##rem ##ent . [SEP] [CLS] so this rule again would n ##' ##t tie the hands of ed balls desperately tightly , if he became chancellor . [SEP] [CLS] that leaves the third and most important pins and lever ##s in the lock , that labour would ` ##` get national debt falling and a surplus on the current budget as soon as possible in the next parliament ' ##' .

[CLS] they say 40 % of coral has died at the dong ##sha atoll in the south china sea . [SEP] [CLS] nothing as severe has happened on dong ##sha for at least 40 years , according to experts . [SEP] [CLS] anne cohen of woods hole ocean ##ographic institution in massachusetts , us , said the high water temperatures of 2015 ##/ ##16 were devastating for reef systems globally , including dong ##sha . [SEP] [CLS] coral b ##lea ##ching - where coral ##s turn white and may die - was the worst on record for australia ' ##s iconic great barrier reef in 2016 . [SEP] [CLS] the barrier reef has absorbed a lot of the attention , but other reefs around the world were also severely affected , said dr cohen . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the 2015 ##/ ##20 ##16 el nino was devastating for reef systems in other parts of the world as well , including dong ##sha atoll and reefs in the central pacific , where some of the most pristine coral reefs are located and of course , the us pacific remote marine national monument , ' ##' she said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we observed devastating b ##lea ##ching in that area as well . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] only last week , scientists published observations of three major die ##- ##offs of coral at the great barrier reef in 2016 , 2002 and 1998 . [SEP] [CLS] they concluded that the only way to preserve the world ' ##s coral reefs is to take drastic action to reduce global warming . [SEP] [CLS] the study of the dong ##sha atoll , reported in the journal , scientific reports , echoes this finding . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` based on what we observed on dong ##sha , a 2 degree cap on ocean warming may not be enough to save coral reefs , ' ##' dr cohen told bbc news . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` this is because coral reefs are shallow water ecosystems and a t ##we ##ak in the local weather can turn that 2 degrees ce ##ls ##ius into a 6 degrees ce ##ls ##ius warming . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the dong ##sha atoll , located in the south china sea , near south ##- ##ea ##ster ##n china and the philippines , is rich in marine life and is regarded as one of the world ' ##s most important coral reefs . [SEP] [CLS] the researchers said on its own , a 2 degrees ce ##ls ##ius rise in temperatures was unlikely to cause widespread damage to coral reefs in the region . [SEP] [CLS] but , a high ##- ##press ##ure system caused temperatures to spike to 6 degrees , leading to the death of 40 % of coral over the course of six weeks . [SEP] [CLS] they argue that predictions of the future of coral reefs may be ` ##` overly optimistic '

[CLS] it found children of minority families do not get enough support to learn cantonese - putting them behind in school and causing long ##- ##ter ##m problems in the jobs market . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` one of the main barriers to equal access has been a de facto racial segregation of ethnic minority students from chinese students in the public school system , ' ##' says university of hong kong law professor , pu ##ja ka ##pa ##i , who carried out the study . [SEP] [CLS] the practice of communities studying separately has also meant that children grow up without interacting with other cultures . [SEP] [CLS] hong kong is home to 365 ##, ##00 ##0 ethnic minority people , making up 6 % of its total population . [SEP] [CLS] communities of indians , pakistani ##s , nepal ##ese and filipino ##s have lived in hong kong for generations . [SEP] [CLS] but the city still lacks a curriculum for children speaking chinese as a second language , which would enable them to learn cantonese , a requirement for many jobs and university places . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the language requirement that forms a barrier for ethnic minorities to receive equal access in education and the labour market , can be seen as an indirect form of discrimination , ' ##' says raymond ho , a senior member of the equal opportunities commission in hong kong . [SEP] [CLS] but he is confident that since the government made it unlawful to disc ##rim ##inate on the grounds of race in 2009 , there is more public awareness of the needs of ethnic minorities .

[SEP] [CLS] lead author of the research , giacomo per ##si pa ##oli , said : ` ##` recent high ##- ##pro ##fi ##le cases have shown that the threat posed by individuals or small groups obtaining weapons illegally from the dark web is real . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the ability to not only arm criminals and terrorists , who can make virtually anonymous purchases , but also vulnerable and fix ##ated individuals is perhaps the most dangerous aspect . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] guns account for less than 1 % of items sold on the platform , with its main trade being in narcotics .

[CLS] the procedure involves holding down the falcon 9 on its launch pad and then ign ##iting its merlin engines . [SEP] [CLS] the test only runs for a few seconds , but it tells engineers that all nine engines at the base of the vehicle , and the sub ##- ##systems that support them , are functioning normally . [SEP] [CLS] if the test throws up no an ##oma ##lies , the falcon is given the green light to go ahead with its mission . [SEP] [CLS] clearly , though , on this occasion , something went catastrophic ##ally wrong . [SEP] [CLS] the entire rocket and its satellite payload were destroyed in an explosion . [SEP] [CLS] company ceo el ##on mu ##sk said the problem - whatever it was - occurred during the operation to fill the rocket with prop ##ellant , so the event happened just prior to the test ignition . [SEP] [CLS] remarkably , the lightning towers surrounding the pad stayed standing in the face of the blast , and so did the erect ##or tower that is used to feed cables and fluids to the rocket . [SEP] [CLS] undoubtedly , though , launch complex 40 as it is known , will have suffered significant damage . [SEP] [CLS] twisted and bent metal was visible to long ##- ##rang ##e cameras . [SEP] [CLS] but the repairs to the pad are only a part of space ##x ' ##s immediate problems . [SEP] [CLS] its launch schedule will now be put on hold , perhaps for many weeks , as engineers try to understand what happened and to correct any procedural errors and hardware failures . [SEP] [CLS] that is going to be a headache for space ##x ' ##s many customers who are waiting patiently for a ride . [SEP] [CLS] the amos ##- ##6 satellite that was lost in the explosion is just one spacecraft in a very long line of platforms that have contracts to fly on the falcon . [SEP] [CLS] they have little option but to accept the delay ; you can not very easily swap rockets like you can swap trains . [SEP] [CLS] most of the back ##log is made up of commercial payload ##s , and every extra month these expensive satellites stay on the ground will hit their operators ' revenues . [SEP] [CLS] consider customers like ir ##idium - one of the main sat ##- ##phone providers . [SEP] [CLS] it was due to send up the first 10 spacecraft in its new constellation of satellites on a falcon later this month . [SEP] [CLS] ir ##idium has big loans that need to be serviced . [SEP] [CLS] at nasa , too , they will be frustrated . [SEP] [CLS] the agency sends cargo to the space station on falcons , and the next freight mission was scheduled for november .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` you knew what you were doing ... for your own sexual pleasure ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] ho ##ugh was jailed for 12 years for mans ##lau ##ght ##er , eight years for rape and eight years for sexual assault - the sentences will run concurrently . [SEP] [CLS] the judge said he took into account the fact ho ##ugh was 16 when he committed the crimes . [SEP] [CLS] janet went missing after leaving her home to go swimming on 7 january 1976 . [SEP] [CLS] four days later , her body was found under a thick ##et near a school playing field . [SEP] [CLS] she had been su ##ff ##oca ##ted during a sexual assault .

[SEP] [CLS] the small number of en ##tra ##nts has gradually increased again in the last 10 years , reaching 45 in 2014 . [SEP] [CLS] sister cathy said nuns were now less visible in communities but they were now doing more hidden work with traffic ##ked women or working as counsel ##lor ##s . [SEP] [CLS] and she added that some women may have been driven to the work after having seen more poverty in the uk during the economic down ##turn . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it does n ##' ##t tend to be those who are coming from quite vulnerable places who become nuns , but there are people who want to be reaching out to those on the margins , who join , ' ##' she said .

[SEP] [CLS] in any case , is n ##' ##t it entirely unusual , almost un ##heard of in modern times , for british military action to take the life of a british citizen ? [SEP] [CLS] the answer to all three of those questions is yes .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` there was a terrorist directing murder on our streets and no other means to stop him , ' ##' the pm said . [SEP] [CLS] although we ' ##ve been told repeatedly british drones have been flying over syria to carry out surveillance , in the small print the government always retained the right to act in ex ##tre ##mis without specific permission from mps . [SEP] [CLS] for number 10 , that action is distinct from its decision on whether to take military action and have raf pilots join us forces flying bombing missions over syria . [SEP] [CLS] the prime minister still wants to persuade mps to back that plan this autumn , although a vote is unlikely until after the party conference season wraps up . [SEP] [CLS] but this strike does add a sense of urgency to those making the arguments for intervention - a reminder that so ##- ##cal ##led is plan and plot in syria , that the direct threat to the uk is real and getting more serious . [SEP] [CLS] but there are calls tonight from opposition politicians for more information and re ##ass ##urance on the particular circumstances around this attack , accusations already that the strike is evidence of british ` ##` mission creep ' ##' .

[SEP] [CLS] where is dead ##man ' ##s island and who owns it ? [SEP] [CLS] it lies at the mouth of the sw ##ale , opposite the town of queen ##borough on the isle of she ##ppe ##y , off the north kent coast .

[SEP] [CLS] it is also an important bird breeding and nesting site . [SEP] [CLS] no , the island is completely out of bounds to the public . [SEP] [CLS] the inside out team was only allowed to visit after receiving permission from the lease ##holder and because it was not the bird breeding season . [SEP] [CLS] who were the people buried there ? [SEP] [CLS] the remains are believed to be those of men and boys who died of con ##tag ##ious diseases on board floating prisons , known as prison hulk ##s , which were moore ##d off the isle of she ##ppe ##y more than 200 years ago . [SEP] [CLS] they were buried in unmarked coffin ##s in six feet of mud . [SEP] [CLS] why are their remains being exposed ? [SEP] [CLS] rising sea levels and coastal erosion over the years have begun to slowly wash away their final resting place , leaving wooden coffin ##s and skeletal remains sticking out of the mud . [SEP] [CLS] they are only visible when the tide is out . [SEP] [CLS] will the bodies be re ##bu ##ried ? [SEP] [CLS] the remains are being washed out into the sea , and would be difficult to re ##- ##bury . [SEP] [CLS] coincidentally , during the napoleonic wars , many french prisoners of war were held around the coast at chatham , with those who died buried on the nearby marshes . [SEP] [CLS] when erosion started to reveal the bodies , they were ex ##hum ##ed and re ##bu ##ried on st mary ' ##s island .

[CLS] the draft investigator ##y powers bill would place a legal duty on internet providers to assist in hacking devices . [SEP] [CLS] but it would not be restricted to phones and pcs , a tech industry chief told the commons science and technology committee . [SEP] [CLS] antony walker , of tech ##uk , said anything that connected to the internet could ` ##` in theory ' ##' be hacked into . [SEP] [CLS] in the future , this could include driver ##less cars or household appliances connected to the internet - the so ##- ##cal ##led internet of things - said mr walker . [SEP] [CLS] he said the home office needed to spell out more clearly where it draws the line over what it calls ` ##` equipment interference ' ##' , highlighting recent concerns about ` ##` smart toys ' ##' that connect to the internet and have microphone ##s and cameras built ##- ##in . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` a range of devices that have been in the news recently , in relation to a hack , are children ' ##s toys , that children can interact with , ' ##' he told the committee . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` these are devices that may sit in a child ' ##s bedroom but are accessible . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` in theory , the manufacturer of those products could be the subject of a warrant to enable equipment interference with those devices . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` so the potential extent , i think , is something that needs to be carefully considered . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] in november , electronic toy company vt ##ech had its app store database hacked , allegedly resulting in the appearance online of personal data including children ' ##s names , dates of birth and gender . [SEP] [CLS] talking dolls , such as hello barbie and my friend ca ##yla , have also been put under scrutiny by security experts in recent months . [SEP] [CLS] barbie manufacturer matt ##el reportedly made modifications to hello barbie , which allows children to talk to the doll over a cloud server connection , after concerns were raised about cyber attackers potentially stealing data through it . [SEP] [CLS] the police , security services , hm revenue and customs and other law enforcement agencies can already hack into devices provided they get a warrant . [SEP] [CLS] this allows them to download the contents of computers or smartphone ##s , track locations , listen to calls , or even switch on microphone ##s and cameras , allowing officers to listen in to conversations or take pictures of those standing nearby .

[SEP] [CLS] ro ##sberg hoped governing body the fia had stuck to the safety guidelines that govern tracks , but added : ` ##` i ' ##m doubt ##ing it a little because of those corners . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the main areas of concern on the new track , which joins both the new and historic old parts of the city and is expected to be the fastest street circuit in f1 history , are turns three , seven and 15 and the pit ##- ##lane entry . [SEP] [CLS] button said : ` ##` we trust in the fia and they do a fantastic job in keeping us safe . [SEP] [CLS] they have improved pretty much every circuit we go to , including monaco . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it ' ##s just that on certain corners here , it looks as if there is not a lot of run ##- ##off . [SEP] [CLS] hopefully i ' ##m wrong .

[SEP] [CLS] the dog ##an news agency added that militants also set up ambush ##es on roads to prevent medical teams getting to the scene . [SEP] [CLS] there has been no comment from the p ##kk so far . [SEP] [CLS] af ##p news agency said it would be the first time the group was accused of deploy ##ing a suicide bomber during recent clashes . [SEP] [CLS] turkey says the group was behind a number of attacks in the last two weeks : [SEP] [CLS] turkey ' ##s official news agency says about 260 kurdish fighters have been killed in strikes in northern iraq and turkey since 24 july . [SEP] [CLS] it has also targeted positions held by the islamic state group .

[CLS] up to six shots were fired at police during a third night of violence in north belfast on tuesday . [SEP] [CLS] petrol bombs and a pipe bomb were also thrown by nationalist riot ##ers in the ar ##do ##yne area . [SEP] [CLS] about 100 officers used water cannon and baton rounds . [SEP] [CLS] the prime minister has said the ps ##ni behaved in a brave and restrained way during the recent trouble . [SEP] [CLS] speaking in the commons , prime minister david cameron described the violence as ` ##` unacceptable ' ##' and said the ps ##ni had been forced to respond . [SEP] [CLS] on wednesday , assistant chief constable duncan mcc ##aus ##land said children as young as 10 were involved in the violence . [SEP] [CLS] he said as well as throwing stones and petrol bombs , young children were being used as shields by ` ##` sinister elements ' ##' organising the riots behind them . [SEP] [CLS] acc mcc ##aus ##land said police had hours of video footage from before the violence started and would use it to identify the riot ##ers . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` there will be significant arrests in the forthcoming days - individuals will not go sc ##ot free , ' ##' he said . [SEP] [CLS] the riot ##er who dropped a concrete block on a police ##woman on monday night - seriously injuring her - had already been identified he added . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` wherever he is in northern ireland he can sit and be worried - we will be coming for him , ' ##' he said . [SEP] [CLS] the officer is due to get out of hospital later on wednesday . [SEP] [CLS] meanwhile , the ni first and deputy first ministers have met the chief constable . [SEP] [CLS] following the meeting , peter robinson said he had ` ##` nothing but the highest admiration for the way the police has dealt with the difficulties of recent days ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] martin mc ##gui ##nne ##ss described the violence as a ` ##` set ##back against the huge progress we have made in recent times ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] but he insisted that those behind the violence ` ##` would not succeed ' ##' in disrupt ##ing the political process . [SEP] [CLS] the ni chief constable , matt bag ##go ##tt , said his force was determined to bring those responsible to justice . [SEP] [CLS] mr robinson and mr mc ##gui ##nne ##ss were criticised on tuesday by assistant chief constable alistair fin ##lay , who called on them to provide more leadership . [SEP] [CLS] on wednesday , searches were carried out in the ar ##do ##yne area in relation to the recent trouble and a number of items were taken away for further examination .

[CLS] he was at last year ' ##s event , then he came to a pre ##- ##ele ##ction rally here at a time when the polls said he was neck ##- ##and ##- ##neck with ed mil ##iba ##nd . [SEP] [CLS] how things change in politics . [SEP] [CLS] in marked contrast to those nervous days for the tori ##es , the walk ##ab ##out today had the feel of a victory parade at times . [SEP] [CLS] with all the challenges he ' ##s got ahead of him , particularly over europe , he may not have come to wales at a better time . [SEP] [CLS] not only was he in a constituency that was one of the tory gains at the election , but also labour are in a mess and he came to wales with news of hundreds of new jobs in the valleys . [SEP] [CLS] the most interesting part of my interview was when i asked him whether he was directly appealing to aston martin to locate production of its new 4 ##x ##4 model to south wales , and he said yes . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s not surprising that david cameron is calling on the car maker to make sure the work is carried out in the uk , and he did hint at that in his answer . [SEP] [CLS] but what will raise eyebrows is the apparent promotion of st at ##han during a visit to wales . [SEP] [CLS] it could be seen as a dangerous game . [SEP] [CLS] politically you can see where he ' ##s coming from . [SEP] [CLS] if aston go with the vale of glamorgan , he can claim the credit which , i have no doubt , will deeply ann ##oy the welsh government which will want to claim the credit for months of hard work behind the scenes . [SEP] [CLS] if aston go elsewhere , then i have no doubt that welsh government ministers will accuse him of sc ##uppe ##ring the deal for a few cheap headlines . [SEP] [CLS] either way , the impression we ' ##ve got here is that david cameron is trying to trying to bounce the car firm into making a decision . [SEP] [CLS] in my experience , companies hate being told what to do by politicians , never mind on a huge call like this one . [SEP] [CLS] but if you are going to have a politician trying to bounce one of the world ' ##s most famous car makers into a particular decision , then i suppose the argument would be that it might as well be the prime minister . [SEP] [CLS] elsewhere in the interview , mr cameron was particularly dismiss ##ive of car ##wyn jones ' claim this week that some of the tory spending plans were ni ##gh on impossible to achieve . [SEP] [CLS] he responded by saying that this was a

[SEP] [CLS] duc ##hen ##ne muscular d ##yst ##rop ##hy is the most severe of the muscular d ##yst ##rop ##hi ##es , according to the action duc ##hen ##ne charity . [SEP] [CLS] the charity said the disease , which affects mainly boys , was 100 % fatal . [SEP] [CLS] suffer ##ers are diagnosed usually by the age of five and without good medical intervention they rarely live beyond their late teens and twenties , it said . [SEP] [CLS] wales was the only country in the uk to screen newborn children for the condition , but screening was withdrawn at the end of november . [SEP] [CLS] the welsh government said the test was no longer reliable .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it is a critical time to invest in research for treatments that will see the condition stab ##ilised to enable our young people to live longer , ' ##' said mr cat ##lin . [SEP] [CLS] he added : ` ##` without further funding and government support we can not achieve our goal of providing personal ##ised care and support into adulthood to improve the quality of life for those living with duc ##hen ##ne .

' ##' [SEP] [CLS] mr tr ##aq ##ua ##ir , who owns wellington farm , said he was unable to invest in sheds or equipment which would make the business more efficient .

[SEP] [CLS] the pope ' ##s visit to the capital , bang ##ui , where many have died in violence between largely muslim se ##le ##ka rebels and mainly christian ` ##` anti ##- ##bala ##ka ' ##' militias , is seen as his most dangerous yet - but potentially also one of his most fruit ##ful as a peace ##- ##maker .

[SEP] [CLS] his capacity to look beyond europe and embrace the concerns of people around the world is also likely to end ##ear him to the faithful , and to those of other faith ##s , as this pope from the southern hemisphere offers a message of hope to the di ##sp ##oss ##essed , and the struggling .

[SEP] [CLS] beta cells in the pan ##cre ##as pump out insulin to bring down blood sugar levels . [SEP] [CLS] but the body ' ##s own immune system can turn against the beta cells , destroying them and leaving people with a potentially fatal disease because they can not regulate their blood sugar levels . [SEP] [CLS] it is different to the far more common type 2 diabetes which is largely due to an un ##hea ##lth ##y lifestyle . [SEP] [CLS] the team at harvard was led by prof doug melt ##on who began the search for a cure when his son was diagnosed 23 years ago . [SEP] [CLS] he then had a daughter who also developed type 1 . [SEP] [CLS] he is attempting to replace the approximately 150 million missing beta cells , using stem cell technology . [SEP] [CLS] he found the perfect cocktail of chemicals to transform embryo ##nic stem cells into functioning beta cells . [SEP] [CLS] tests on mice with type 1 diabetes , published in the journal cell , showed that the lab ##- ##made cells could produce insulin and control blood sugar levels for several months . [SEP] [CLS] dr melt ##on said : ` ##` it was gr ##ati ##fying to know that we could do something that we always thought was possible . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we are now just one pre ##- ##cl ##ini ##cal step away from the finish line . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] however , his children were not quite so impressed : ` ##` i think , like all kids , they always assumed that if i said i ' ##d do this , i ' ##d do it . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] if the beta cells were injected into a person they would still face an immune assault and ultimately would be destroyed . [SEP] [CLS] more research is needed before this could become a cure . [SEP] [CLS] sarah johnson , from the charity jd ##rf which funded the study , told the bbc : ` ##` this is n ##' ##t a cure , it is a great move along the path . [SEP] [CLS] it is a tremendous step forward .

[CLS] character actor wall ##ach - who began his film career in 1956 after 10 years on stage - was admired for his wide range in a career spanning six decades . [SEP] [CLS] his portrayal of bandit chief cal ##vera in the magnificent seven was regarded by many as his definitive role . [SEP] [CLS] when he received an honorary oscar in 2011 , he was described as a ` ##` qui ##ntes ##sen ##tial cha ##mel ##eon ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] though he was never nominated for an oscar during his 60 ##- ##year career , the academy rewarded him in 2011 for ` ##` effortlessly inhabit ##ing a wide range of characters , while putting his in ##imi ##table stamp on every role ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] his films included the classic western ##s how the west was won and the mis ##fi ##ts . [SEP] [CLS] arguably best known for his villains , he made a lasting impression as tu ##co opposite clint eastwood , in sergio leone ' ##s 1966 spaghetti western the good , the bad and the ugly . [SEP] [CLS] years later , wall ##ach said strangers would recognise him and start whistling the distinctive theme tune . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` as an actor i ' ##ve played more bandits , thieves , warlord ##s , mole ##sters and ma ##fi ##oso than you could shake a stick at , ' ##' the hollywood reporter quoted him as saying . [SEP] [CLS] he was also successful in light comedy and appeared in many tv shows , including playing mr freeze for a spell in the 1960s batman tv series . [SEP] [CLS] the veteran star continued making films into his 90s , making his last big screen appearance in wall street : money never sleeps in 2010 . [SEP] [CLS] his death was confirmed by his daughter katherine in the new york times . [SEP] [CLS] wall ##ach was born on 7 december 1915 in brooklyn to polish jewish immigrants . [SEP] [CLS] he graduated from the university of texas , initially intending to become a teacher . [SEP] [CLS] but his focus shifted to acting , and after serving in world war ii he studied at the actors ' studio , where he became a practitioner of method acting . [SEP] [CLS] he first appeared on the new york stage in 1945 , where he met his wife anne jackson , to whom he was married for 65 years . [SEP] [CLS] wall ##ach made his london debut in 1954 with the tea ##house of the august moon . [SEP] [CLS] his screen debut came two years later , playing an un ##sc ##rup ##ulous seduce ##r in baby doll .

[CLS] the network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance , but could eventually encompass more than 2 ##, ##00 ##0 . [SEP] [CLS] the aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe . [SEP] [CLS] in particular , the project wants every school to have a connection . [SEP] [CLS] building so large a constellation requires a step ##- ##chang ##e in the manufacture of satellites - especially for airbus . [SEP] [CLS] it can take europe ' ##s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today ' ##s specialist platforms . [SEP] [CLS] but for the one ##we ##b venture , it is all about high volume and low cost . [SEP] [CLS] that means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes . [SEP] [CLS] the idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece . [SEP] [CLS] the boss of airbus , tom end ##ers , con ##cede ##s he initially thought the one ##we ##b concept to be fantasy . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` everything in space as you know traditionally has been ` gold ##- ##plate ##d ' ; it had to work perfectly , - ##ls ##b ##- and have - ##rs ##b ##- the most expensive materials , etc ##. [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` here , we ' ##ve had to go other ways , to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for one ##we ##b , ' ##' he told bbc news . [SEP] [CLS] airbus and one ##we ##b have inaugurated the first assembly line in toulouse , france . [SEP] [CLS] two further lines will be set up in a soon ##- ##to ##- ##open factory complex in florida . [SEP] [CLS] the most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite clean ##room is the trolley robot , which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations . [SEP] [CLS] but the ` ##` revolution ' ##' here goes far beyond automation ; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan . [SEP] [CLS] the first 10 satellites to come off the toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in april next year . [SEP] [CLS] another batch will follow into orbit around november . [SEP] [CLS] and then the launch cadence will kick on ap ##ace . [SEP] [CLS] the establishment of the one ##we ##b constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of space ##flight .

[CLS] the claims against the agricultural commodities trader were made in a report by mighty , a us ##- ##base ##d environmental lobby group . [SEP] [CLS] mighty also accuse ##s ol ##am and its main stake ##holder , singapore state ##- ##own ##ed investment company te ##mas ##ek , of turning a blind eye to these practices . [SEP] [CLS] both companies reject the allegations . [SEP] [CLS] singapore and malaysia regularly suffer from haze caused by slash ##- ##and ##- ##burn practices by small ##- ##sca ##le farmers and rogue palm oil traders in indonesia . [SEP] [CLS] indonesia is often blamed for not doing enough to tackle the agriculture fires used to clear vegetation for palm oil , pulp and paper plantations in the ri ##au province in east sumatra , south sumatra , and parts of kali ##man ##tan on indonesian borneo . [SEP] [CLS] singapore ##- ##base ##d ol ##am has confirmed that it buys 99 % of its palm oil from third party suppliers and while it is a relative newcomer to the industry , it says it accounts for less than 1 % of the global market . [SEP] [CLS] mighty ' ##s report says ol ##am and te ##mas ##k could be un ##wi ##tting ##ly encouraging un ##sus ##tain ##able palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires . [SEP] [CLS] it also says ol ##am created a ` ##` secretive market for rogue palm oil companies ' ##' that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources . [SEP] [CLS] but ol ##am chief executive sunny ve ##rgh ##ese told the bbc that the firm had a ` ##` very vigorous sour ##cing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning , so it ' ##s a ` no burn ##- ##no peat ##- ##no def ##orestation ' compliance policy ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] the company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on monday , having previously resisted calls by mighty to do so . [SEP] [CLS] mr ve ##rgh ##ese said he believed the firm ' ##s current suppliers all met ol ##am ' ##s strict requirements , but added that the vet ##ting and verification process would take several more years to complete . [SEP] [CLS] he added that producers who do not comply with the company ' ##s sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain . [SEP] [CLS] since te ##mas ##ek is the majority stake holder in ol ##am , mighty ' ##s allegations could link singapore ' ##s state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting singapore , thailand , malaysia and indonesia - if the claims of sour ##cing from rogue palm oil producers are proven .

[CLS] an amsterdam judge told the tech firm to release internet and email addresses , phone numbers and names related to four reviewers , one of whom assumed the identity of a dead woman . [SEP] [CLS] google deleted the reviews but the nursery ' ##s lawyer said it has not yet handed over the information . [SEP] [CLS] google is reviewing the decision . [SEP] [CLS] the nursery , which was not named in the judge ' ##s ruling , complained that the reviews were making serious and un ##founded claims that it was neglect ##ing children , and that this was harm ##ing its business . [SEP] [CLS] three of the reviews were removed by google for breach ##ing its anti ##- ##sp ##am rules after the nursery complained , including one written in the name of a woman who died in the us in november 2006 . [SEP] [CLS] others were found to have been copied and paste ##d from other websites . [SEP] [CLS] in a ruling handed down last week , the judge cm be ##rk ##ho ##ut ordered the fourth to be removed because it too was in breach of the rules . [SEP] [CLS] google was given two weeks to hand over the information related to the four accounts - all of which remain active on google + - as well as the exact dates and times the reviews were posted . [SEP] [CLS] it was also told to pay more than [UNK] ‚ ¬ 1 ##, ##500 - ##lr ##b ##- [UNK] # 1 ##, ##100 , $ 1 ##, ##60 ##0 - ##rr ##b ##- to the nursery by the same date . [SEP] [CLS] paul t ##jia ##m of simmons and simmons , who represented the nursery , said he believed the case would make it more difficult for fake reviewers to ` ##` hide themselves behind their computers . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] he added that the nursery would contact the people behind the fake reviews before deciding whether or not to pursue civil action against them . [SEP] [CLS] he told the bbc that fake reviews online were not just an issue in the netherlands , but a ` ##` worldwide problem . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] he said the courts ' decision ` ##` shows that google has a long way before its notice ##- ##and ##- ##take ##- ##down policy functions properly . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] mr t ##jia ##m said it was ` ##` stunning ' ##' that google allowed the reviews to remain online . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` hopefully , another consequence of this decision is that it will make google re ##thi ##nk their own policies and the way they enforce their policies .

[SEP] [CLS] but just as new technology created the problem originally , new technology may help to solve it . [SEP] [CLS] five years ago , the environment agency commissioned a new app to track japanese knot ##weed , using the crowd ##- ##so ##ur ##cing principle .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` hopefully it will mean people will become a bit more aware of the problems , and what to look for . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] so far the results show a particular concentration of knot ##weed in south wales , the midlands , london , scotland ' ##s central belt and cornwall - where the plant was also introduced by victorian ##s into ornamental gardens . [SEP] [CLS] those looking for a property can use the app to find out if knot ##weed has been found nearby - but the fact it is not on the map does not mean it is not present ; it is simply that no one has reported it . [SEP] [CLS] the data provided by the plant ##tra ##cker app is also added to the national biodiversity network - ##lr ##b ##- n ##bn - ##rr ##b ##- atlas , which aims to track the whereabouts of all the uk ' ##s plants and animals , from bee orchid ##s to go ##shaw ##ks .

[CLS] county london ##der ##ry man smyth , 25 , is continuing his preparations for the paralympics in london where he will defend his t ##13 100 ##m and 200 ##m titles . [SEP] [CLS] however , smyth is already thinking ahead to the 2016 olympics in rio . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i want to give it another really good shot over the next four years and get what i did n ##' ##t get this year , ' ##' he said .

[SEP] [CLS] smyth became the first paralympic athlete ever to compete at a european championships in barcelona in 2010 and his progression on the able ##- ##bo ##die ##d circuit continued last year when he was selected for the world championships in da ##eg ##u . [SEP] [CLS] the 25 ##- ##year ##- ##old remains determined to reach his olympic goal in rio even though the 100 ##m qualifying mark for the games in brazil may be even quicker than the london a standard of 10 ##. ##18 . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` at one stage , i was wondering whether i wanted to keep going but i want to reach my potential and i have n ##' ##t done that yet , ' ##' added smyth whose has less than 10 per cent of normal sight because of the star ##gard ##t ' ##s condition . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` europeans and world championships are good stepping stones to try and compete at the olympics and i will be aiming to compete in those events in the run ##- ##up to rio as well my normal paralympic competitions .

[CLS] the advertising standards authority - ##lr ##b ##- asa - ##rr ##b ##- says it should be made more obvious , before viewers click play , that clips contain promoted products .

[SEP] [CLS] but ebony day and fl ##eur def ##or ##ce think that would be a step too far . [SEP] [CLS] fl ##eur de force has more than one million youtube subscribers .

[SEP] [CLS] she told news ##beat it ' ##s important to be open about sponsorship but thinks putting that information in top section of the info bar is enough . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i ' ##ve been very vocal about disc ##los ##ing sponsored content and it does need to be regulated , ' ##' she explained .

[SEP] [CLS] i was 13 months old at the time and he was a welcome brother to complete the hen ##nessy family . [SEP] [CLS] he was baptised at st dominic ' ##s roman catholic church and at the age of five , he joined me at the church school . [SEP] [CLS] we later moved to st sa ##vio ##ur ' ##s roman catholic school in elle ##sm ##ere port , where our dad had started a new job .

[SEP] [CLS] we used to go on family holidays to but ##lins with our extended family and jimmy enjoyed going because we had cousins of a similar age to us . [SEP] [CLS] religion played a big part in our family life . [SEP] [CLS] i remember we used to have to go to mass and he would tell our parents that he was going to eight o ##' ##cl ##ock mass , but go off and play with his friends .

[CLS] early indications are of wide variations nationwide , with up to one in six missing out on their first choice of school in some areas . [SEP] [CLS] while in other areas , almost all got their number one preference . [SEP] [CLS] it comes days after council leaders said two in five local authorities would have too few places by 2016 . [SEP] [CLS] pressure is growing , particularly in schools on london ' ##s fringe ##s and in cities such as leicester , nottingham , reading and peterborough . [SEP] [CLS] however , in london , around 99 ##, ##00 ##0 pupils or 95 % received a place at one of their six preferred schools this year - up 1 ##, ##100 and nearly five percentage points from last year . [SEP] [CLS] of those , 81 % got into their first preference school , the same proportion as the two previous years . [SEP] [CLS] but there were wide local variations within the capital . [SEP] [CLS] in kensington and chelsea , only 59 % got their first preference , while in barking and da ##gen ##ham it was 91 % . [SEP] [CLS] this comes against a backdrop of an extra 900 applications in the capital this year . [SEP] [CLS] the crisis has been pre ##ci ##pit ##ated mainly by a booming birth ##- ##rate , partly by immigration and by families moving specifically to be near popular schools . [SEP] [CLS] the demand for school places has risen steep ##ly in harrow , which has some very good primary schools . [SEP] [CLS] it was predicted to be 12 % over capacity by this september but the council said it had worked really hard to ensure there are enough places for harrow children this year . [SEP] [CLS] a spokesman said the crush harrow was seeing now was very likely to affect other areas around the country soon . [SEP] [CLS] initial results from a press association survey of town halls shows families in some areas are more likely to gain a place at their top choice than in others . [SEP] [CLS] results from birmingham show 84 ##. ##7 % of children starting reception have got a place at their first preference , while 94 ##. ##8 % got one of their listed choices .

[CLS] the social network ' ##s chief operating officer she ##ryl sand ##berg confirmed the decision to retain peter th ##iel during her appearance at the code conference . [SEP] [CLS] mr th ##iel has said he wants to challenge ga ##wk ##er ' ##s ` ##` bullying ' ##' behaviour . [SEP] [CLS] but he has been criticised for using his wealth to try and silence part of the media . [SEP] [CLS] that poses a potential issue for facebook at a time when it is trying to convince parts of the industry to host articles on its platform , provide it with exclusive video content and allow the tech firm to sell advertising on their behalf . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` peter did what he did on his own , not as a facebook board member , ' ##' ms sand ##berg told attendees at the california event . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we have very independent board members with very independent thoughts that they share publicly . [SEP] [CLS] those strong people make really good board members because they have strong views and they ' ##re not afraid to think differently than other people , which has served facebook well . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] but one expert questioned whether the decision to keep on mr th ##iel - who was one of facebook ' ##s early investors - was sustainable in the long ##- ##ter ##m . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` facebook has always fundamentally seen itself as a technology company , but is now having to deal with the public position - and also the ethics and responsibilities - of being a publisher , ' ##' media consultant steve he ##wl ##ett told the bbc . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` imagine that this person were sitting on the board of the times or the bbc - that would look like an obvious conflict of interest . [SEP] [CLS] you ca n ##' ##t have a billionaire sitting on a publisher ' ##s board who is sui ##ng other people for publishing things . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` so , if you think of facebook as being a publisher , this is plainly problematic . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the clash between ga ##wk ##er and mr th ##iel dates back to 2007 , when the media firm published an article headlined : ` ##` peter th ##iel is totally gay people ' ##' .

[SEP] [CLS] when rival pope ##s were elected for political reasons in different parts of europe during the late middle ages , it caused confusion and conflict within the church .

[SEP] [CLS] pope benedict , or rather emeritus pope benedict to give him his new official title , lives only a few hundred metres away from his successor pope francis . [SEP] [CLS] the two pope ##s visit each other occasionally and communicate fairly frequently by telephone and letter . [SEP] [CLS] pope benedict , who for the previous eight years was one of the world ' ##s highest profile public figures , now keeps deliberately out of the lime ##light . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` he lives discreet ##ly without a public life , but that does n ##' ##t mean he is isolated , ' ##' says father federico lombard ##i , the vatican ' ##s official spokesman . [SEP] [CLS] the 86 ##- ##year ##- ##old former pope spends his time very quietly : reading , praying , studying , handling correspondence , receiving occasional visitors . [SEP] [CLS] he also plays mozart and beethoven on the baby grand piano that he brought with him when he left the spacious papal apartments in the apostolic palace . [SEP] [CLS] the same four consecrated lay ##wo ##men - who kept house for him when he was pope - continue to run his more modest new household . [SEP] [CLS] they have been photographed with him , taking his daily walk with the aid of a black cane in the well mani ##cured vatican gardens behind st peter ' ##s basilica , an oasis of tran ##quil ##lity ##. , situated in the heart of rome , yet sheltered from the din and traffic chaos of the italian capital .

[SEP] [CLS] key to her evidence was the release of the dec ##lassified assessment which she wrote in march 2002 , a year before the invasion of iraq .

[SEP] [CLS] in the fox news interview , mr trump was asked about the protests faced by some republican politicians at town hall meetings across the country .

[SEP] [CLS] the paris prosecutor , francois mo ##lins said according to witnesses the two groups had run into each other by chance in a busy shopping district near st la ##zar ##e train station , where a fight broke out . [SEP] [CLS] he said the arrested suspects claimed to have responded to pro ##vocation by the left ##- ##wing group . [SEP] [CLS] all five suspects went before a judge on saturday , two days after they were detained .

[CLS] andrew hal ##dan ##e said in a speech he was down ##beat over the uk economy because of weaker global growth , low wage growth and financial and political risks . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` put in rather plain ##er english , i am gloom ##ier , ' ##' mr hal ##dan ##e said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` this implies interest rates could remain lower for longer , certainly than i had expected three months ago . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] global markets have tumbled this week , with investors disco ##nce ##rted at the lack of growth in europe and especially greece , the impact of e ##bola , and worrying economic data from china and the us . [SEP] [CLS] previously , uk interest rates had been expected to rise early next year . [SEP] [CLS] mr hal ##dan ##e made his remarks at a speech to local business leaders in ken ##il ##worth , where he described the uk ' ##s economy as ` ##` writhing in both agony and ecstasy ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] he said there were still plenty of reasons to be cheerful . [SEP] [CLS] growth is set to be the fastest of any major economy this year and inflation and borrowing costs are low , he said . [SEP] [CLS] however , he said the ` ##` reasons to be fearful ' ##' included productivity and wages , which had not risen . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` if there is genuine uncertainty about the path of the economy , the optimal policy response may be to avoid the worst outcomes , ' ##' said mr hal ##dan ##e . [SEP] [CLS] sterling dropped 0 ##. ##5 % against the dollar following his remarks . [SEP] [CLS] share trading on the london market has been volatile . [SEP] [CLS] mr hal ##dan ##e ' ##s caution about global economic prospects were echoed by the chancellor , george osborne , who told the bbc that the worldwide economy was ` ##` more unstable than it has been for some time ' ##' .

[SEP] [CLS] dj ##oko ##vic , the world number one , can finally add the one major title to have so far el ##uded him . [SEP] [CLS] it will be the pair ' ##s seventh meeting in a grand slam final . [SEP] [CLS] dj ##oko ##vic leads that head ##- ##to ##- ##head 4 ##- ##2 , their overall contests 23 ##- ##10 and has 11 major titles to murray ' ##s two - but it was the serb whom murray beat to claim his grand slam victories at the us open in 2012 and wimbledon in 2013 .

[SEP] [CLS] there is a huge amount at stake for both men in sunday ' ##s final , with murray again looking to match fred perry , britain ' ##s last male champion in 1935 . [SEP] [CLS] sue barker won the women ' ##s title in 1976 but since then a surprise run to the semi ##- ##fin ##als by tim hen ##man in 2004 , followed by three semi ##- ##fin ##als for murray , were the best any brit ##on had managed on the paris clay . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it ' ##s obviously a very big match for both of us , novak trying to win the career slam and me trying to win my first french open , ' ##' murray said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` neither of us know how many more chances we ' ##ll have to win here . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a very tough event to win .

[CLS] conversations with arab and western sources make it clear there is a major un ##ifying goal in these new discussions : to avoid the collapse of syria ' ##s security forces and its civilian institutions . [SEP] [CLS] that means all sides are now moving away from rigid positions taken when syria ' ##s uprising erupted more than four years ago . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] - ##ls ##b ##- president basha ##r al - - ##rs ##b ##- ass ##ad leaving before the process starts does n ##' ##t make sense any more , ' ##' a senior arab diplomat in the region told me . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` if he leaves suddenly , two ##- ##thi ##rds of his commanders would go with him and syria would collapse . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the steady rise of the so ##- ##cal ##led islamic state , and mounting pressures on a stretched syrian army has run ##g alarm bells over the threat of an un ##go ##vern ##ed syria falling into the hands of ex ##tre ##mist ##s . [SEP] [CLS] the risk posed by another fractured middle east country is now too big to ignore . [SEP] [CLS] so is this summer ' ##s tragic exodus of hundreds of thousands of syrian ##s desperate to reach europe . [SEP] [CLS] then , the startling september surprise of russia ' ##s air sort ##ies into syria set the stage for the most determined diplomacy of syria ' ##s crisis . [SEP] [CLS] ideas emerging from arab and western capitals include a ceasefire , an amnesty for forces on both sides , and a transitional government intended to ensure an orderly process that would lead to the drafting of a new constitution and elections . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s talk of a transition that could last up to two years . [SEP] [CLS] some of these ideas are also appearing in reports about proposals coming from russia and iran . [SEP] [CLS] iran has had its own ` ##` four ##- ##point plan ' ##' for a few years , which was studied with interest by the un . [SEP] [CLS] but it stayed on the shelf while iran was kept out of talks . [SEP] [CLS] integrating an array of armed forces will be fra ##ught with difficulties , if not dangers , but there is a hope that the reform of civilian structures is within easier reach . [SEP] [CLS] sources speak of discussions concerning which senior members of president ass ##ad ' ##s team would be asked to leave - a figure of 10 - ##15 people was cited . [SEP] [CLS] there ' ##s also a hope that new , more credible , leaders will emerge from the opposition during this period to replace figures seen as lacking support inside syria .

[CLS] a shocking claim , based on figures from the office of national statistics . [SEP] [CLS] the data for england and wales shows that in 2015 , hunger and ##/ ##or de ##hy ##dra ##tion were a factor in 82 ##8 patient deaths in hospitals and care homes . [SEP] [CLS] but that does n ##' ##t mean all of these patients starved to death or died of thirst , experts at the on ##s were quick to point out when i spoke with them about it . [SEP] [CLS] mal ##nut ##rit ##ion may be recorded on the death certificate as a factor contributing directly to a death when it was a com ##plication of a different underlying cause , such as cancer of the stomach , for example . [SEP] [CLS] if you are very sick , it might not be feasible or desirable to eat and drink . [SEP] [CLS] having a disease such as advanced cancer can cause mal ##nut ##rit ##ion . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s not to say that patients who are terminal ##ly ill should have fluid and nutrients with ##held . [SEP] [CLS] on the contrary , guidelines make it clear that even if a patient ca n ##' ##t eat or drink they should still be provided for . [SEP] [CLS] they were drawn up after reports revealed some patients at the end of life were being denied this basic right when they were put on a care protocol called the liverpool care pathway . [SEP] [CLS] the lc ##p was scrapped in 2015 after relatives complained that their loved ones had been put on it without their knowledge and denied fluids , which haste ##ned their deaths . [SEP] [CLS] another dark period in history for the nhs was the stafford hospital scandal , where hundreds of patients died amid app ##all ##ing levels of care between 2005 and 2009 . [SEP] [CLS] an inquiry identified terrible and unnecessary suffering , including examples where patients had been provided with food and drink , but it had been left out of their reach . [SEP] [CLS] joan morris , 83 , was admitted to stafford hospital in december 2006 with a chest infection . [SEP] [CLS] her family said that food and water had been left on a table instead of being given to her . [SEP] [CLS] another patient , tom wilhelm ##s , resort ##ed to drinking from a vase . [SEP] [CLS] in response to the francis inquiry into the failing ##s at the mid staffordshire foundation trust , the government published new hospital standards including around nutritional and hydra ##tion care .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` this is the hardest game since we started qualification , ' ##' he said . [SEP] [CLS] ivanov ##ic scored in the 6 ##- ##1 thrash ##ing of wales in 2014 world cup qualifying at novi sad , in september 2012 - the heaviest defeat in coleman ' ##s reign . [SEP] [CLS] a year later he was part of the side which won 3 ##- ##0 at the cardiff city stadium - the last time wales lost a home qualifier .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we know that and we have to be careful with that . [SEP] [CLS] we have to play much much better than last time to get something from the game because wales is a completely different team from that moment , ' ##' he continued . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` those kind of games happen may be once in 100 years . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s very difficult to win against one team three times in a row even when the opponent is not that strong and you can not say that about wales .

[SEP] [CLS] the visitors will be without the suspended manchester city defender ale ##ks ##ander ko ##lar ##ov , who is suspended after collecting two booking ##s in the group . [SEP] [CLS] wales will welcome the return of arsenal midfielder aaron ramsey for the first time in this campaign after his recovery from a ham ##st ##ring injury .

[CLS] mr straw introduced the act in 2000 but his place on a panel examining its work has been criticised by campaign ##ers . [SEP] [CLS] the ex ##- ##lab ##our mp has said inquiries about ministerial communications and the formulation of government policy should not be allowed any more . [SEP] [CLS] but he told the bbc the review would weigh the evidence carefully including that from groups opposed to the act . [SEP] [CLS] the review was launched by the cabinet office amid concerns within government that ` ##` sensitive information ' ##' was not being protected . [SEP] [CLS] the campaign for freedom of information , however , says the panel does not include any advocates for transparency . [SEP] [CLS] it suggests changes will see more requests being refused , resulting in ` ##` bad decisions and policy mistakes ' ##' concealed . [SEP] [CLS] the five ##- ##me ##mber committee also includes former conservative home secretary michael howard , some of whose decisions in government were disclosed using the act . [SEP] [CLS] it will be headed by lord burns , the most senior civil servant in the treasury between 1991 and 1998 .

[SEP] [CLS] mr frank ##el added : ` ##` jack straw has already made his views - ##ls ##b ##- clear - ##rs ##b ##- on all the issues - he ' ##s in favour of restricting the act to make it impossible to obtain policy advice or internal discussions , he ' ##s in favour of introducing charges for information and making it harder for people to obtain information .

[CLS] the home office decided to halt the detained fast track - ##lr ##b ##- d ##ft - ##rr ##b ##- system amid concerns over safeguard ##s , particularly for ` ##` vulnerable applicants ' ##' .

[SEP] [CLS] of those , it is estimated that about 100 may have to be released . [SEP] [CLS] the system , introduced in 2000 , accelerate ##s legal hearings and appeals while keeping the individual detained . [SEP] [CLS] it is used in cases which officials believe can be decided quickly . [SEP] [CLS] last month the court of appeal ordered the home office to halt the system immediately after an earlier high court hearing concluded it contained ` ##` structural unfair ##ness ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] high court judge mr justice nico ##l put a ` ##` legal stay ' ##' - a temporary delay - on his ruling on 12 june , following a case brought by campaign group detention action . [SEP] [CLS] this meant the fast ##- ##tra ##ck system remained in operation until the government had exhausted all opportunities to appeal . [SEP] [CLS] bbc home affairs correspondent danny shaw said officials were worried their procedures were not as robust as they should be . [SEP] [CLS] in a statement to the house of commons , mr broken ##shire said the system had ` ##` come under significant legal challenge ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` risks surrounding the safeguard ##s within the system for particularly vulnerable applicants have also been identified to the extent that we can not be certain of the level of risk of unfair ##ness to certain vulnerable applicants who may enter d ##ft . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` in light of these issues , i have decided to temporarily suspend the operation of the detained fast ##- ##tra ##ck policy . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i hope this pause to be short in duration , perhaps only a matter of weeks , but i will only resume operation of this policy when i am sure the right structures are in place to mini ##mise any risk of unfair ##ness . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the decision to suspend the process means those asylum seekers detained and awaiting hearings will be re ##asse ##ssed at a ` ##` senior level ' ##' to see if they can be released from detention to continue their asylum application in the normal way . [SEP] [CLS] mr broken ##shire added : ` ##` those who meet the general criteria for detention will not be directly affected by the decision to suspend d ##ft .

[CLS] compared with other european countries , many apprenticeship ##s are low quality and too short , the sutton trust warns .

[SEP] [CLS] the department for education says apprenticeship ##s are being reformed to ` ##` drive up standards ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] the association of colleges said some existing apprenticeship ##s were respected by industry and should be preserved .

[SEP] [CLS] the report also notes that england ' ##s vocational system has 18 ##, ##00 ##0 different qualifications , while germany has 330 . [SEP] [CLS] the report warns that since 2010 , more than half - ##lr ##b ##- 58 % - ##rr ##b ##- of apprenticeship ##s have been below level three and three ##- ##qua ##rter ##s have been aimed at those over the age of 25 , many of whom are already in work .

[SEP] [CLS] in his foreword to the report , sutton trust chairman sir peter lamp ##l said the report had found that , with some exceptions , the opportunities on offer to young people who did not go to university were ` ##` poor ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] the attitude in england , with some exceptions , was very different to that in countries such as germany and switzerland , he said .

[CLS] marginal ##ly missing the grades needed , or even getting much better results than expected , can throw everything into turmoil . [SEP] [CLS] with only a few days to secure a university place or take an alternative path , good advice is crucial . [SEP] [CLS] experts alex neill of which ? [SEP] [CLS] university and tom laws of the national careers service are on hand to offer personal ##ised advice . [SEP] [CLS] my daughter received her as results this morning which were disappointing . [SEP] [CLS] she got bs in the two subjects she sat , with her other two subjects coming under the new rules where she simply takes her a ##- ##lev ##el in those two subjects next year . [SEP] [CLS] she is predicted an a * in english and 2 ##s at a ##- ##lev ##el but wonders what the impact of the as b grades will have . [SEP] [CLS] she was hoping to study english at durham . [SEP] [CLS] her father wants her to res ##it the year , change schools or just give up which is totally over the top . [SEP] [CLS] any advice would be most welcome . [SEP] [CLS] firstly , congratulations to your daughter on what is a good set of as results . [SEP] [CLS] with promising grades like these i certainly would n ##' ##t suggest she gives up either ! [SEP] [CLS] the entry requirements for durham university ' ##s english literature ba course are certainly competitive : a * aa at a ##- ##lev ##el for 2017 . [SEP] [CLS] if she has her heart set on going there , i ' ##d suggest she sits down to discuss the year ahead and the work she ' ##ll need to put in with her subject tutor ##s , as well as having an informal chat on the phone with an admissions tutor if possible . [SEP] [CLS] remember she has five options to apply for on her uc ##as form , so researching some alternative un ##is and heading to a few open days will be worth doing to keep her options open . [SEP] [CLS] all the best in the year to come ! [SEP] [CLS] the the most important thing at the moment is to see how your daughter feels - after all , she is going to be the one doing the hard work . [SEP] [CLS] res ##itt ##ing the as year is the most likely way of increasing her grade . [SEP] [CLS] she could certainly look at changing to a different school if she feels the quality of teaching or environment is the reason for her grades , but the downs ##ide would be having to adjust to new surroundings which could affect her studies . [SEP] [CLS] durham university will look at her as grades when considering any application but if her teachers have predicted that she can get the right grades then

[SEP] [CLS] one mother has gone a step further and filmed the aftermath of her mis ##carriage for a documentary , to challenge the secrecy surrounding it . [SEP] [CLS] lisa francesca nan ##d , from greenwich , has suffered five mis ##carriage ##s in total , including one the day before her 12 ##- ##week scan . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` one minute i was pregnant , we were planning the future and thinking about being a mummy and daddy . [SEP] [CLS] then suddenly , in the space of a few hours , we were no longer going to be parents , it was heartbreak ##ing , ' ##' she says . [SEP] [CLS] the experience made her determined to share her story . [SEP] [CLS] one scene shows her husband david waiting outside the hospital while she has the remains of their second un ##born child removed from her body . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` they had sent me home to pass the sac . [SEP] [CLS] it took a week of walking around with a dead baby inside me for it to come out . [SEP] [CLS] and i bled for six weeks afterwards . [SEP] [CLS] no ##- ##one talks about the physical pain , so i did n ##' ##t expect it . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i started filming a video diary because no ##- ##one talks about it . [SEP] [CLS] i want people to understand they are not alone , ' ##' adds lisa , who has since gone on to have two healthy boys . [SEP] [CLS] so why are mis ##carriage ##s still sh ##roud ##ed in mystery ? [SEP] [CLS] ruth bender at ##ik , national director of the mis ##carriage association , thinks it is because of the ` ##` rule ' ##' that women should not announce their pregnancy before their first scan . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` most mis ##carriage ##s happen in the first three months . [SEP] [CLS] if you do n ##' ##t tell people you are pregnant then sadly you are not going to get the support that you need when you are gr ##ieving . [SEP] [CLS] it does n ##' ##t suit everyone to talk about their pregnancy before their scan , but it can help . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we do n ##' ##t tell people ` in case something happens ' , but that can reinforce the idea that you should keep it a secret if you mis ##car ##ry , ' ##' ms bender at ##ik said . [SEP] [CLS] the reason behind a mis ##carriage is often unclear - leaving women with no one to blame but themselves , she adds . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` most women never find

[CLS] in england , only schools with academy status are allowed to form trusts to sponsor weaker schools . [SEP] [CLS] and , the local government association said , a shortage of ` ##` good quality ' ##' sponsors often left failing schools ` ##` in the dark about their future ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] ministers said there was no legal frame for council schools to be sponsors . [SEP] [CLS] the local government association says 91 % of council maintained schools are rated good or outstanding by education watch ##dog of ##sted - so they should be allowed ` ##` to play a direct role in raising education standards and improving life chances , including taking on the running of failing academies ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] new analysis of of ##sted ratings for the l ##ga by education analysts angel solutions found a higher percentage of good and outstanding grades among council maintained schools than among academies . [SEP] [CLS] of 14 ##, ##8 ##90 council maintained schools inspected , 91 % are rated good or outstanding by of ##sted , compared with 85 % of 5 ##, ##0 ##58 academies , say the researchers . [SEP] [CLS] there are wide variations within the academy category , with sponsored academies , which are forced into academy status after poor of ##sted ratings , predict ##ably far ##ing worse than convert ##er academies , which must be rated good or outstanding before being allowed to convert . [SEP] [CLS] the l ##ga points out that the majority of academies are convert ##er academies . [SEP] [CLS] inspection ratings for 4 ##, ##10 ##3 convert ##er academies showed 89 % rated good or outstanding but among the 95 ##5 sponsored academies inspected the figure was only 65 % , according to the analysis . [SEP] [CLS] richard watts , chairman of the l ##ga ' ##s children and young people board , said the figures proved councils had ` ##` the track record , experience and expertise to help lift schools out of academic failure ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the government must commit to removing the unnecessary red tape and give high performing maintained schools the option of becoming academy sponsors . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` councils want to be regarded as improvement partners , not obstruction ##ists to school improvement , ' ##' said mr watts , who is also the leader of is ##lington council . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` with a shortage of academy sponsors and struggling schools currently in the dark about their future the simplest remedy is to give councils the power to turn these schools around where this is the best option locally .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it ' ##s pretty disappointing . [SEP] [CLS] we thought there were a lot of positive ##s out of the first two tests ... but in fairness to the all blacks i thought they were absolutely outstanding . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] wales , without a win over new zealand since 1953 , were beaten 39 ##- ##21 in the first test at eden park , before a 36 ##- ##22 defeat in wellington . [SEP] [CLS] steve hansen ' ##s side blew wales away in sci ##nti ##lla ##ting spells in those games , crossing for five tries in each . [SEP] [CLS] ga ##tland ' ##s team also suffered an embarrassing 40 ##- ##7 defeat against super rugby side the chiefs , who were missing all eight of their current all blacks . [SEP] [CLS] in dunedin , wales could only muster two first ##- ##hal ##f dan big ##gar penalties as the all blacks ran in six tries without reply . [SEP] [CLS] it was wales ' heaviest defeat since a 62 ##- ##5 thrash ##ing by england in 2007 . [SEP] [CLS] but asked if his players would be better for the experience , ga ##tland said : ` ##` yeah , absolutely .

[CLS] satellite images show colonies moving their locations in years when the thin sea ice on which they habit ##ually breed forms late or is absent . [SEP] [CLS] scientists report the observations in the online journal pl ##os one . [SEP] [CLS] they reveal the birds travelling long distances to find alternative sites . [SEP] [CLS] these are further in towards the coast , up on the ice shelves - the thick slabs of glacier ice that ju ##t out over the ocean . [SEP] [CLS] it is a surprise because these shelves are frequently faced with cliffs that may be tens of metres high in places . [SEP] [CLS] but somehow , the emperors find a way up to breed , and also to come and go as they for ##age for the seafood that will sustain their chicks . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we thought that in years when the sea ice was bad , they just did n ##' ##t breed , but they ' ##re clearly more adapt ##able than that , ' ##' said lead author peter fr ##et ##well from the british antarctic survey . [SEP] [CLS] the emperor is the most south ##erly of the antarctic penguin species and the only one to breed on sea ice in the southern winter . [SEP] [CLS] their reliance on these thin seasonal marine fl ##oes as a reproductive platform , coupled with concern about how the patterns of antarctic sea ice could change in a warming world , has led to the species being designated as ` ##` near threatened ' ##' on the iucn red list . [SEP] [CLS] currently , the extent of winter sea ice in the antarctic is growing year by year , albeit slowly . [SEP] [CLS] the coverage does however vary considerably by region , and climate computer models indicate any gains will very likely be reversed later this century . [SEP] [CLS] but this study on four colonies around the continent suggests emperors do have the capacity to meet and beat some of the challenges that may lie ahead . [SEP] [CLS] in the observations of shack ##leton ice shelf in east antarctica , for example , the penguins are seen to be very adept at finding the routes that allow them to get past a 30 ##m ##- ##hi ##gh cliff . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` when they go out from the colony to for ##age , they go down the steep cliff - the shortest route to the sea . [SEP] [CLS] we ' ##re not sure how they get down - they may slide down or jump down , ' ##' mr fr ##et ##well told bbc news . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` but this cliff is too steep for them to climb back up and so they must return a different way , likely through an ice creek . [SEP] [CLS] this route is 5 ##km longer and we know they take it

[CLS] the firm will resume in ##- ##house domestic vinyl production at a japanese factory south ##- ##west of tokyo by march 2018 . [SEP] [CLS] the move comes amid renewed demand for old ##- ##fa ##shi ##oned black plastic records , which now occupy a key market niche . [SEP] [CLS] at one time , the format had been expected to disappear after the rise of cds , digital downloads and streaming . [SEP] [CLS] during vinyl ' ##s long decline from the late 1980s onwards , many vinyl record factories closed down , with production confined to a few specialist independent firms .

[SEP] [CLS] sony , which played a major part in killing off vinyl by developing cds , has seen them replaced in turn by other music technology such as downloads and streaming , but vinyl is increasingly popular once again . [SEP] [CLS] the format has been saved by a resurgence in demand , as it attracts not only nos ##tal ##gic older consumers , but also younger generations who have rediscovered records , especially in clubs and at music festivals . [SEP] [CLS] sony is even struggling to find older engineers who know how to make records . [SEP] [CLS] part of the reason for the popularity of vinyl records may be that you can actually sell them in shops . [SEP] [CLS] in the uk , record sales brought in more money last year than streaming platforms - although the unit costs of vinyl is many times that of streaming . [SEP] [CLS] vinyl records have been growing in popularity again in recent years , boosted by events such as record store day in april every year , for which record companies produce special limited ##- ##ed ##ition singles and albums . [SEP] [CLS] sony ' ##s move comes a few months after it equipped its tokyo studio with a cutting la ##the , used to produce the master discs needed for manufacturing vinyl records .

[CLS] the independent police complaints commission said there were six fatal police shooting ##s between april 2016 to march 2017 , up from three in 2015 ##/ ##16 . [SEP] [CLS] the number of deaths in police road traffic incidents rose by 11 to 32 - the biggest total in eight years . [SEP] [CLS] the six shooting ##s included that of westminster attacker khalid mas ##ood . [SEP] [CLS] it is the highest number in 12 years . [SEP] [CLS] twenty ##- ##ei ##ght of the road traffic deaths were related to police pursuits of vehicles . [SEP] [CLS] since the ip ##cc was set up in 2004 , there have never been more than a handful of fatal police shooting ##s in a year , so the fact there have been six is unlikely to raise alarm bells . [SEP] [CLS] and , as the watch ##dog points out , the number has to be set in context : there were more than 14 ##, ##70 ##0 police firearms operations during the same 12 ##- ##mont ##h period - the vast majority pass off without a shot being fired , let alone anyone dying . [SEP] [CLS] however , the sharp rise in pursuit ##- ##rel ##ated deaths - after a concert ##ed effort by police and the ip ##cc to reduce the number of such casualties - will prompt searching questions . [SEP] [CLS] of the 28 who died , 18 were either passengers in the suspect vehicle or other road users . [SEP] [CLS] does the rise simply reflect an ups ##urg ##e in criminal activity ? [SEP] [CLS] is it because suspects have become increasingly reckless ? [SEP] [CLS] or have police standards on the roads slipped ? [SEP] [CLS] the ip ##cc and the national police chiefs ' council will have to get to the bottom of it quickly . [SEP] [CLS] dame anne owe ##rs , chair ##woman of the ip ##cc , said the six fatal shooting ##s occurred across six forces . [SEP] [CLS] the shooting of khalid mas ##ood was the only one related to terrorism . [SEP] [CLS] the watch ##dog said the investigation into that case and two others had been completed and all three found no evidence of any misconduct by firearms officers . [SEP] [CLS] in addition , another inquiry , which is still ongoing , is also yet to find any evidence of wrong ##do ##ing by police . [SEP] [CLS] investigations into two other shooting ##s are still to conclude . [SEP] [CLS] the national police chiefs council and the ip ##cc will examine whether changes to police pursuit safety or training are needed after the rise in road traffic deaths , added dame anne . [SEP] [CLS] the ip ##pc data also showed there were 14 deaths in police custody - the second lowest figure it has recorded . [SEP] [CLS] eight of the 14 people who died were reported to have mental

[CLS] we ' ##ve learned a lot about the end of the journey , the slave camps and mass graves in the jungle ##s of thailand and malaysia .

[SEP] [CLS] we travelled to southern bangladesh , where many of the migrants set off on their per ##ilo ##us voyages . [SEP] [CLS] what we have discovered brings a shocking new dimension to this story that speaks of the terrible desperation that is driving this vast movement of people . [SEP] [CLS] we met one of the people smug ##glers on what bangladeshi ##s proudly bo ##ast is the world ' ##s longest beach - a vast stretch of sand that runs for more than 120 ##km along the southern coast . [SEP] [CLS] let ' ##s call him kam ##ru ##l rahman . [SEP] [CLS] he appeared to be in his early 30 ##s . [SEP] [CLS] he said he used to be a fisherman and started in the people smuggling rack ##et greedy for money after his business went belly up . [SEP] [CLS] as the surf crashed down on the beach beside us , he calmly explained in chilling detail how the business worked . [SEP] [CLS] he said the prison camps were an essential part of the business model and all the migrants knew about them . [SEP] [CLS] it seems they are part of what amounts to a sinister and hideous ##ly cynical marketing trick the people smug ##glers have evolved : they offer the voyage for virtually no up ##front cost . [SEP] [CLS] he said the deal was straightforward and understood by everyone involved . [SEP] [CLS] you only pay the main charge - about [UNK] # 1 ##, ##500 - ##lr ##b ##- $ 2 ##, ##30 ##0 - ##rr ##b ##- when you arrive in southern thailand . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` so the migrants know they will be held in camp before they get to malaysia ? ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` before they leave from here we tell them if they do n ##' ##t pay they will be put in a prison .

[SEP] [CLS] they all confirmed his account . [SEP] [CLS] without exception , they said they knew migrants would be held in thailand until full payment was made .

[CLS] pont ##io at bangor university was due to open in september and is largely being paid for with public funds .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the great roger hunt went to the by ##- ##line , squared it back to me and from all of those six yards out i powered it in , ' ##' said wallace who was only playing because ian st john was ill . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s more than 55 years since he left ll ##ane ##lli for liverpool , but wallace has not lost a trace of his welsh accent .

[SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a story that takes in one of wales ' most famous rugby academies and huddersfield town . [SEP] [CLS] wallace , now 71 , recalls it all with fond ##ness . [SEP] [CLS] wallace was five years old when his father , former scotland centre forward doug ##ie wallace , was appointed player ##- ##mana ##ger at ll ##ane ##lli afc . [SEP] [CLS] as a teenager he went to gwen ##dra ##eth school , where barry john - nicknamed the king - and before him car ##wyn james took their first steps to rugby star ##dom .

[CLS] exports of the fish jumped more than 53 % by value to # 40 ##8 ##m , the food and drink federation - ##lr ##b ##- f ##df - ##rr ##b ##- said . [SEP] [CLS] uk food and drink exports rose 8 ##. ##5 % to # 10 ##. ##2 bn , helped by the fall in the pound after last year ' ##s br ##ex ##it vote . [SEP] [CLS] but the f ##df warned that without a favourable br ##ex ##it trade deal , british exports could become less competitive . [SEP] [CLS] whisky remained the top export , while salmon was second , and beer rose to third , over ##taking chocolate . [SEP] [CLS] but while the volume of salmon exports rose by 24 % , whisky exports actually fell 1 % by volume , and beer exports fell 2 ##. ##2 % . [SEP] [CLS] the pound has fallen sharply against the dollar and euro since the uk voted to leave the eu in june last year , giving a boost to uk exports , as they have become relatively cheaper . [SEP] [CLS] however , the weaker pound has also pushed up costs for british businesses that bring in food and raw materials from abroad , the f ##df said . [SEP] [CLS] it said the uk ' ##s food and drink trade deficit - the difference between how much the uk imports and exports - widened 16 % to # 12 ##. ##4 bn over the period . [SEP] [CLS] british salmon is becoming more popular globally , according to andy bing , sales director of loch du ##art salmon in north west scotland . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` this half we ' ##ve sold more than we ever have , ' ##' he said , adding that the firm ' ##s main export markets were france , the us , italy , and switzerland . [SEP] [CLS] uk salmon exports have grown after chilean producers suffered problems in 2015 with al ##gal blooms that killed a large amount of their fish , he said . [SEP] [CLS] looking ahead , the firm is optimistic about the eventual post ##- ##bre ##xi ##t trade deals that can be struck with eu countries . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` europe needs lovely scottish salmon just as we need lovely french wine and wonderful german cars , ' ##' he said . [SEP] [CLS] however , he added that loch du ##art was ` ##` finding it difficult to plan without better guidance ' ##' from the government about br ##ex ##it . [SEP] [CLS] the two biggest import ##ers of uk food and drink are ireland and france .

[CLS] it was a ` ##` good opportunity ' ##' and ` ##` a chance to work together , ' ##' a top western sahara official told the bbc .

[SEP] [CLS] africa live : more on this and other stories [SEP] [CLS] find out more about western sahara [SEP] [CLS] a referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wr ##ang ##ling over who was eligible to vote . [SEP] [CLS] thousands of sa ##hra ##wi refugees still live in refugee camps in algeria - some have been there for 40 years . [SEP] [CLS] it is not clear what happens next but western sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the au will address the issues that both sides have raised . [SEP] [CLS] some au delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with morocco inside the au . [SEP] [CLS] sid ##i mohammed , a western sahara official , told the bbc that morocco ' ##s return to the au means that it would now be expected to put ` ##` in practice decisions taken by the au with regard to a referendum in western sahara ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] mr mohammed dismissed the suggestion that morocco would now seek to get the au to change its position , saying that the no country could un ##ila ##tera ##lly change the au fundamental agreement , saying it opposed colon ##isation . [SEP] [CLS] in his speech at the au summit , king mohammed vi of morocco said the read ##mission was not meant to divide the continental body . [SEP] [CLS] algeria has always been a big supporter of western sahara ' ##s pol ##isa ##rio front and it had wanted morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for read ##mission . [SEP] [CLS] zimbabwe and south africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted morocco back in the fold . [SEP] [CLS] there is no specific provision in the au charter that bars any country from joining it . [SEP] [CLS] morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two ##- ##thi ##rds of the 53 members . [SEP] [CLS] morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in july last year to rejoin the continental body . [SEP] [CLS] king mohammed toured various african countries seeking support for the bid . [SEP] [CLS] while culturally the country ' ##s identity align ##s with arab states , its economic interests increasingly lie in africa . [SEP] [CLS] this is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining , construction , medical , insurance and banking sectors on the continent .

[SEP] [CLS] the report was based on interviews with staff from 13 elite account ##ancy , law and financial services firms . [SEP] [CLS] the study by royal holloway , university of london , on behalf of the commission , examined barriers to entry for people from less privileged backgrounds to these elite firms . [SEP] [CLS] it found that despite attempts to improve social inclusion over the past 10 to 15 years , such elite firms continue to be heavily dominated at entry level by people from privileged social backgrounds .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` this was reflected in more diver ##gence in the life expect ##ancy , so by the time you get to about 1970 it was at its peak - the difference in life expect ##ancy was about 5 ##. ##7 years .

[SEP] [CLS] every part of their team did their bit but the biggest reason for their success is one man , jose mo ##uri ##nh ##o . [SEP] [CLS] media playback is not supported on this device [SEP] [CLS] the blues manager is a serial winner who lives for titles and trophies - and he knows exactly how to get what he wants . [SEP] [CLS] i do n ##' ##t accept the ` boring boring chelsea ' ji ##bes his side have faced recently . [SEP] [CLS] i think that is utter rubbish . [SEP] [CLS] it is not chelsea ' ##s problem if teams can not beat them , and it is pretty embarrassing if they then call them boring . [SEP] [CLS] the only tag the blues deserve is ` worthy champions ' because that is what they are . [SEP] [CLS] everyone else has a lot of catching up to do . [SEP] [CLS] one of the biggest reasons chelsea won the title is that , unlike his rivals , mo ##uri ##nh ##o identified what he needed last summer , and went out and got it . [SEP] [CLS] i am sure he was hurt by what happened to chelsea last season , his first back at stamford bridge since his last spell ended in 2007 . [SEP] [CLS] despite not having a really top ##- ##class centre ##- ##for ##ward they went very close to winning the title . [SEP] [CLS] near ##- ##mis ##ses do n ##' ##t mean anything to mo ##uri ##nh ##o , though . [SEP] [CLS] he addressed the main issue holding his side back by signing diego costa , who has scored the goals that were missing . [SEP] [CLS] chelsea were also lacking a bit of gui ##le in midfield , and ce ##sc fa ##bre ##gas has provided the extra creativity there . [SEP] [CLS] his midfield partnership with ne ##man ##ja mat ##ic , who mo ##uri ##nh ##o signed in january 2014 to sit and police the back four , is just one part of a team system that works perfectly . [SEP] [CLS] chelsea have some top players , but their squad also has a great hunger and desire . [SEP] [CLS] that is down to their manager .

[CLS] sports ##cot ##land says it has yet to decide where the cuts will fall amid concerns that elite athletes could suffer . [SEP] [CLS] the cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in national lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing .

[SEP] [CLS] in the year ending 2015 , total revenue was # 65 ##. ##1 m , which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports . [SEP] [CLS] by the end of next year , that figure will have fallen to # 51 ##. ##8 m - a cut to the scottish sporting budget of 20 % in just three years . [SEP] [CLS] sports ##cot ##land chairman mel young said : ` ##` it ' ##s heartbreak ##ing to me because i know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that ' ##s around it ; the volunteers and the mum ##s and dad ##s . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` and , to have to say that we ' ##re having to cut some money back is , i believe , not the right way to go .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it ' ##s almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the scottish government said sport and physical activity play a ` ##` key role ' ##' in a healthy scotland and that ` ##` significant ' ##' investment would continue in those areas . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` having successfully delivered the commonwealth games - ##ls ##b ##- in 2014 - ##rs ##b ##- we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances , and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities , ' ##' minister for sport ai ##leen campbell said .

[CLS] according to cancer research uk some 41 , 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year , but 10 ##, ##70 ##0 will die of the disease , making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men . [SEP] [CLS] given such a dire pro ##gno ##sis , and let ' ##s face it , given the financial profile of its victims , you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prior ##itis ##ed and well researched areas of on ##cology . [SEP] [CLS] not a bit of it . [SEP] [CLS] perhaps it ' ##s because men are sq ##ue ##ami ##sh , or do n ##' ##t like to talk about their health or visit the doctor , but prostate cancer has long been dubbed ` ##` the cinderella cancer ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we just do n ##' ##t make enough of it ' ##' according to consultant on ##col ##ogist professor neil burn ##et . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` on the whole men are less vocal about their health , and older men tend to be even more st ##oic ##al , preferring to grin and bear it . [SEP] [CLS] but it means men are poor advocates , and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] based at add ##en ##brook ##e ' ##s hospital on the outskirts of cambridge , prof burn ##et is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radio ##therapy treatments , and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate . [SEP] [CLS] the technique , called image guided intensity mod ##ulated radio ##therapy treatment uses imaging provided by a ct scan to target the tu ##mour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` what limits what we can do with radio ##therapy are the side effects of the treatment , the toxicity . [SEP] [CLS] and , since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next , targeting the treatment is really important . [SEP] [CLS] the second half of this technology is in delivering intensity mod ##ulated radio ##therapy , which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tu ##mour . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] but if image guided im ##rt offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer , how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage ? [SEP] [CLS] that - at least in part - was the motivation behind the collaborative on ##col ##ogical gene ##/ ##en ##vir ##on ##ment study , or co ##ges , which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast , o ##var ##ian and prostate cancer .

[SEP] [CLS] he told the greek people that the lend ##ers had resort ##ed to ` ##` blackmail ' ##' in order to impose more aus ##ter ##ity . [SEP] [CLS] after five years of recession and welfare cuts many ordinary greeks feel bitter that they have suffered while europe ' ##s business elite recovered quickly from the financial crisis .

[SEP] [CLS] however , the eu has no mechanism for a country to leave the euro - it has never happened before . [SEP] [CLS] what will the question be ?

[CLS] ` ##` fra ##cking ' ##' involves pumping water and chemicals into shale rock at pressure . [SEP] [CLS] the joint report from the royal society and royal academy of engineering say the technique is safe if firms follow best practice and rules are enforced . [SEP] [CLS] ex ##pl ##ora ##tory fra ##cking is being mo ##oted in at least seven sites around the uk . [SEP] [CLS] the report was commissioned by the government ' ##s chief scientist , sir john bed ##dington , following the decision last year to halt the uk ' ##s most advanced project , in lancashire , after fra ##cking caused small earth tremor ##s . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` our main conclusions are that the environmental risks of hydraulic fra ##cturing for shale can can be safely managed provided there is best practice observed and provided it ' ##s enforced through strong regulation , ' ##' said the report ' ##s chair , prof robert mai ##r from cambridge university . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the uk regulatory system is up to the job for the present very small scale exploration activities , but there would need to be strengthening of the regulators if the government decides to proceed with more shale gas extraction , particularly at the production stage , ' ##' he told bbc news . [SEP] [CLS] the report contains 10 top ##- ##line recommendations for strengthening regulations , including : [SEP] [CLS] fra ##cking , or hydraulic fra ##cturing , involves drilling down into shale formations and fra ##cturing the rock using explosives or hydraulic pressure . [SEP] [CLS] water is pumped in containing sand particles that prop open the cracks in the shale , allowing the gas out , and a tiny amount of chemicals . [SEP] [CLS] in the us , concerns have been raised that the gas or the chemicals can enter drinking water supplies . [SEP] [CLS] however , the report concludes that gas contamination should not be a problem - the risk is ` ##` very low ' ##' - provided that fra ##cking takes place at a depth of many hundreds of metres , a long way below the level of a ##qui ##fers , and that the wells are properly constructed . [SEP] [CLS] each well is lined with layers of steel and cement ; and if this stays intact , the scientists conclude , gas leak ##age should not be a problem . [SEP] [CLS] they also say that with good management of waste water , chemical contamination should be avoided ; they critic ##ise the us practice of leaving it in open ponds , which would not be permitted in the uk .

[SEP] [CLS] he left the bank in 1999 to work as an executive director at the im ##f , but returned to mexico in 2000 , serving as deputy finance minister under president vicente fox , marking his first ties with the conservative national action party .

[SEP] [CLS] it is understood that a significant number of r ##hi recipients have told the department for the economy they do not wish their names made public . [SEP] [CLS] the department had written to them asking for views on their names being released . [SEP] [CLS] mrs foster and mr hamilton have talked of wanting transparency about who benefited .

[CLS] i am compelled to write and seek review of an historic case of rape .

[SEP] [CLS] this is shocking in itself . [SEP] [CLS] it further troubles me that the senior police officer who dropped the case revealed to the victim he apparently took a series of worthless stereotypes and other irrelevant points into consideration . [SEP] [CLS] he did this after apparently consulting with an unnamed cp ##s official . [SEP] [CLS] most of these stereotypes have been blown out of the water in recent months . [SEP] [CLS] there has been a sea change in the climate surrounding rape , historic cases in particular . [SEP] [CLS] why is it that the tide has not reached this case ?

[SEP] [CLS] i hope i am wrong . [SEP] [CLS] but in my view the case demands your personal attention and an immediate review by the cp ##s area head of sexual offences . [SEP] [CLS] as you know , i have been working with the metropolitan police on a number of cases involving sexual crimes over the last 18 months . [SEP] [CLS] i have been the recipient of a considerable amount of information from victims directly , much of which i have passed on to the police .

[SEP] [CLS] the former swimmer ' ##s sentence prompted an out ##cr ##y , with critics saying the judge had been overly len ##ient and sex assaults on us campuses were not being treated seriously enough . [SEP] [CLS] prosecutors had demanded a sentence of six years in state prison .

[CLS] in order to assess the important question of whether the big contractors , ser ##co , g ##4 ##s , at ##os and capita , are making excessive profits from their [UNK] # 4 ##bn of annual business with the public sector , the government ' ##s spending watch ##dog had to rely to a great extent on information volunteered to them by the four . [SEP] [CLS] which seems something of a lac ##una , given that a huge and rising proportion of our public services are delivered by the private sector . [SEP] [CLS] according to the na ##o , contracting out , to the likes of ser ##co , g ##4 ##s , at ##os and capita , accounts for ` ##` around half of the [UNK] # 187 ##bn that the public sector spends on goods and services each year ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] or to put it another way , contracting out represents around 15 % of all public spending and 5 % of uk gdp . [SEP] [CLS] private sector delivery of public services is therefore hugely important to the effectiveness of the functioning of the state and to the productivity of the economy . [SEP] [CLS] yet it is only written in to some contracts that they are ` ##` open book ' ##' , that the client - ##lr ##b ##- that ' ##s you by the way , the taxpayer - ##rr ##b ##- has a formal right to know how much money the private company is actually making from a particular contract . [SEP] [CLS] so what did the na ##o actually learn about the profit ##ability of the big four outs ##our ##cing companies from the information they supplied ? [SEP] [CLS] well the big four say that in 2012 their respective operating margins - the profits they typically make as a percentage of sales - on government contracts were lower than the operating margin they earn on average on all contracts . [SEP] [CLS] so on that basis , if the numbers are reliable , it would be hard to argue that the government is being ripped off . [SEP] [CLS] but there are three qualifications to make : [SEP] [CLS] they are all making an operating margin on government work in the ball ##park of 5 % , with capita and ser ##co apparently generating a sm ##idge more than at ##os and g ##4 ##s . [SEP] [CLS] but is there anything magical and appropriate about that 5 % number ? [SEP] [CLS] now the na ##o points out that the net margin for these companies for all their work - for public ##- ##se ##ctor and private ##- ##se ##ctor work - is a bit less than the average for ft ##se 100 companies . [SEP] [CLS] but that may not be a useful comparison . [SEP] [CLS] given the long term nature of the public ##- ##se ##ctor contracts , and that
[CLS] under an informal rotating principle , the ninth secretary general should be an eastern european . [SEP] [CLS] but the region risks losing that chance because of luke ##war ##m backing for national candidates at home , and a regional failure to pull together to back one individual . [SEP] [CLS] an informal selection procedure , made more transparent this year by open hearings , has produced 11 candidates so far , eight of them from eastern europe . [SEP] [CLS] the former or current foreign ministers of moldova , macedonia , montenegro , croatia , serbia and slovakia , plus the former president of slovenia are all in the race . [SEP] [CLS] bulgaria has proposed irina bo ##kova , current head of unesco , the cultural and educational wing of the un . [SEP] [CLS] helen clark to run for un top job [SEP] [CLS] close observers at the un say the candidates risk crowd ##ing each other out - leaving the way open for other strong candidates including susan ##a mal ##cor ##ra of argentina , helen clark from new zealand , or the tough ##- ##talk ##ing former un ##hc ##r head , antonio gut ##erre ##s from portugal . [SEP] [CLS] in july , a straw poll among the 15 members of the security council should give a clearer idea of the backing , or lack of support , for each . [SEP] [CLS] even more candidates could also step forward in the coming weeks . [SEP] [CLS] another bulgarian states ##woman , kris ##tale ##na georgie ##va , is widely rum ##oured to be on the brink of announcing her candidacy . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i am obviously watching the race closely . [SEP] [CLS] a lot of people are urging me to enter . [SEP] [CLS] let ' ##s see what happens , ' ##' she told the bbc . [SEP] [CLS] behind the scenes , several countries are said to be considering no ##minating her . [SEP] [CLS] ms bo ##kova was an early front ##runner , and enjoyed crucial russian backing . [SEP] [CLS] but her chances have been harmed by a damn ##ing investigation of the inner workings of unesco in recent months , and by her support for palestinian statehood - frowned on by the us government . [SEP] [CLS] nearly half of unesco ' ##s budget currently goes on staff salaries . [SEP] [CLS] by way of contrast , ms georgie ##va has a strong record as an administrator at the world bank , and as a former eu commissioner for humanitarian affairs and current commissioner for budget ##ary affairs .

[CLS] after last year ' ##s test which focused on a collapse in house prices in the uk , this year ' ##s test will have a more international flavour . [SEP] [CLS] under the scenario , global growth will fall , the chinese economy slow markedly and the uk and the euro ##zone will face a new bout of recession with rising unemployment and falling property prices . [SEP] [CLS] in britain , the economy will contract by 2 ##. ##3 % . [SEP] [CLS] as the bank gr ##apple ##s with the new crisis , interest rates in the uk are cut to zero . [SEP] [CLS] and as the global economy slump ##s , the oil price collapses to $ 38 and def ##lation - causing companies to withdraw investment - ` ##` increases the real burden of debt and increases market concerns ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] the world would see the worst levels of def ##lation since the 1930s . [SEP] [CLS] some major global banks and companies could default on debt repay ##ments . [SEP] [CLS] to be clear , the bank ' ##s five ##- ##year scenario does not mean it believes these events will happen . [SEP] [CLS] this is what is called a ` ##` tail ##- ##ris ##k ' ##' event . [SEP] [CLS] it could happen but the probability is exceeding ##ly low . [SEP] [CLS] but then again , no ##- ##one predicted the severity of the financial crisis . [SEP] [CLS] and actually this scenario is not as bad as what actually happened in 2008 , even though it is put in place to try to stop those cal ##ami ##tou ##s events ever occurring again . [SEP] [CLS] six banks will have their balance sheets tested against this stress test - hs ##bc , barclay ##s , royal bank of scotland , lloyd ##s , santa ##nder uk and standard chartered . [SEP] [CLS] the building society nationwide will also be tested . [SEP] [CLS] many believe that this will be a tough ##er test for banks with large international businesses - hs ##bc and standard chartered - than the uk domestic test of last year . [SEP] [CLS] co ##- ##op bank , a mainly uk bank , has been dropped from this year ' ##s test . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` last year ' ##s stress test demonstrated how much stronger the core of the uk financial system has become since the financial crisis , ' ##' said mark car ##ney , the governor of the bank of england .

[CLS] to be 80 ##- ##5 and give away a 200 ##- ##run lead is a problem in any test , let alone one where you know the pitch is going to get more difficult to bat on later in the match . [SEP] [CLS] however , for as tricky as the surface became - and some deliveries did do a lot - there were too many dismissal ##s in england ' ##s second innings in particular that were not down to the pitch . [SEP] [CLS] the tourists were shown the way initially by ben stokes and jonny bai ##rst ##ow in the first innings , then by opening pair ala ##sta ##ir cook and has ##ee ##b ham ##eed in the second . [SEP] [CLS] yet , english collapses - michael vaughan has referred to a ` ##` little disease ' ##' when panic appears to set in - were common . [SEP] [CLS] four wickets for 29 runs and then four wickets for 30 runs in the first innings , eight wickets for 68 runs on the final day . [SEP] [CLS] it ultimately comes down to a batsman ' ##s state of mind . [SEP] [CLS] when you get a difficult delivery or the ball mis ##be ##ha ##ves , it can be very hard to put that out of your thoughts , but that is what the very best are able to do . [SEP] [CLS] the ability to clear your mind and focus on the next delivery is a skill my test match special colleague geoffrey boycott speaks of so often . [SEP] [CLS] media playback is not supported on this device [SEP] [CLS] so it seems that the next three tests in this series will be about england ' ##s minds ##et . [SEP] [CLS] can they play every ball on its merits ? [SEP] [CLS] can they keep their chin ##s up if they lose the toss ? [SEP] [CLS] can they be positive without being reckless ? [SEP] [CLS] can they remember that they have played some good cricket ? [SEP] [CLS] do they believe that they can beat india ? [SEP] [CLS] the answers to those questions are not straightforward because india is such a difficult place to tour . [SEP] [CLS] we knew from the start that playing five matches here straight after two in bangladesh was going to be difficult in terms of managing morale and keeping spirits high . [SEP] [CLS] england do not have to look too far into the past for inspiration . [SEP] [CLS] they came from behind to win here four years ago .

[SEP] [CLS] the silent documentary , filmed in 1927 after ja ##ure ##gui and three others had spent 10 years in jail , captures the young man moments before his execution , smiling nervously at the camera .

[SEP] [CLS] the film fragments are shocking enough , but they are part of an even more dramatic story . [SEP] [CLS] according to bolivian law at the time , when three or more people were found guilty of the same crime , only one faced execution . [SEP] [CLS] their fate was sealed by drawing lots - in this case a black ball . [SEP] [CLS] but there was another twist - it subsequently emerged ja ##ure ##gui was in all likelihood innocent , as were the other three . [SEP] [CLS] the film , the last work by bolivian filmmaker luis del castillo , a photo ##jou ##rna ##list turned movie director , was ce ##nsor ##ed as soon as it was released and remained unseen for 85 years . [SEP] [CLS] news cutting ##s from the time show the film was not banned because of its violent images , but rather from the fear that if it were seen abroad , it could expose bolivia and its judicial system to international criticism . [SEP] [CLS] there was also concern among bolivia ' ##s european ##- ##des ##cend ##ed elite that the people shown in the film were mainly indigenous men and women , which , in their eyes , would also damage bolivia ' ##s reputation . [SEP] [CLS] ja ##ure ##gui , who was only 16 when pan ##do died , was caught up in the political mach ##inations of the era .

[SEP] [CLS] douglas garcia fun ##es from the salvador ##ean national police says intelligence suggests that gang members are already ` ##` being used by or are operatives for the transport of drugs and money towards the united states , passing through mexico ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] in a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world , this is a sober ##ing scenario . [SEP] [CLS] it could bring more chaos to an already violent country , many salvador ##ean ##s say - and the government seems to be bracing for the worst .

[SEP] [CLS] the incident on 7 july occurred after the pilot ` ##` inadvertently ' ##' headed for the area where jets were due to depart . [SEP] [CLS] he was ordered to pull up and the airbus 320 circled and landed safely . [SEP] [CLS] as the plane approached the taxi ##way , which runs parallel to the runway , it is estimated that it flew just 30 ##m above two aircraft waiting to depart , a preliminary report by canada ' ##s transportation safety board - ##lr ##b ##- ts ##b - ##rr ##b ##- said . [SEP] [CLS] after receiving a warning , the pilot pulled up and the plane rose about 60 ##m above a third jet and about 90 ##m above a fourth , the ts ##b said . [SEP] [CLS] flight ac ##75 ##9 had already travelled almost 400 ##m over the taxi ##way before ab ##ort ##ing the landing , the board ' ##s report added .

[SEP] [CLS] the flight was scheduled to land at 23 ##: ##23 local time - ##lr ##b ##- 06 ##: ##23 gm ##t - ##rr ##b ##- but touched down at 00 ##: ##11 .

[CLS] just as the fighting for mo ##sul moved from east to west over the course of many months , the iraqi military is now moving westward ##s towards the syrian border . [SEP] [CLS] although much smaller in size , tal afar has been a so ##- ##cal ##led islamic state - ##lr ##b ##- is - ##rr ##b ##- stronghold that the jihad ##ist group has used as a strategic ` ##` base ' ##' since 2014 . [SEP] [CLS] and tal afar has had ruthless rulers before - between late 2004 and early 2006 , the city was controlled by al ##- ##qa ##eda in iraq , a precursor to is . [SEP] [CLS] before it fell to is , the city ' ##s population of 200 ##, ##00 ##0 was predominantly ethnic turk ##men , a turkic people who have their own language and customs . [SEP] [CLS] the majority were also sunni muslims . [SEP] [CLS] tal afar ' ##s residents are not viewed as helpless victims by many in the region ; for a relatively small population , security sources say a di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ate number of men from the city filled the ranks of is as commanders , judges and members of their vicious religious police . [SEP] [CLS] the battle for tal afar could also es ##cala ##te tensions between iraq , its ethnic kurdish minority , turkey and syria . [SEP] [CLS] turkey refuses to close or move its military base near mo ##sul , claiming it could be needed to protect iraqi turk ##men as well as the turkish border . [SEP] [CLS] the mere idea of turkish military action on iraqi soil has been enough to cause many , from washington to baghdad , to lose sleep . [SEP] [CLS] kurdish leaders in ir ##bil are also keeping their eyes wide open as well - jug ##gling the real or perceived threats from sunni arab insurgents , turkish forces and an ever ##- ##gr ##owing number of shia arab militia ##men . [SEP] [CLS] tal afar is a two hour drive from the turkish border , and the main road from mo ##sul to syria runs through the city . [SEP] [CLS] it is , in many ways , the perfect location - and the right time - for a perfect storm . [SEP] [CLS] the military assault on tal afar might seem clear cut , but the combination of forces involved invites complications on the ground . [SEP] [CLS] approximately 40 ##, ##00 ##0 troops are taking part in the fighting - three iraqi army divisions , iraqi and us ##- ##led coalition special forces personnel , as well as ` ##` government ##- ##back ##ed ' ##' paramilitary fighters from the popular mob ##ilis ##ation - ##lr ##b ##- hash ##d al ##- ##sha ##abi - ##rr ##b ##- .

[CLS] a tentative deal is believed to have been reached in talks with senior us justice department officials . [SEP] [CLS] the fine relates to the sale of securities based on home loans , which led to the near ##- ##coll ##ap ##se of the banking system in 2007 . [SEP] [CLS] if confirmed , it would be the biggest settlement ever paid by an us company . [SEP] [CLS] last month , jp morgan was fined almost $ 1b ##n in the ` ##` london whale ' ##' scandal , which arose from huge disastrous bets on the financial markets placed by former bank employee bruno ik ##sil . [SEP] [CLS] the tentative deal to pay the $ 13 ##bn fine to the justice department was reached during the talks on friday , between jp morgan lawyers with us attorney general eric holder and his deputy tony west , the wall street journal said , citing officials familiar with the decision . [SEP] [CLS] the new york times also reported that the investment bank was nearing the agreement . [SEP] [CLS] neither the justice department nor the bank was available for comment . [SEP] [CLS] but the reports said that while the fine would settle all civil claims , the us bank would still face possible federal criminal charges being pursued in california or individual criminal claims . [SEP] [CLS] the $ 13 ##bn sum is said to include $ 9 ##bn in fines and a further $ 4 ##bn in relief for struggling home ##own ##ers . [SEP] [CLS] in the run ##- ##up to the financial crisis , sophisticated financial products known as mortgage ##- ##back ##ed securities were created by many investment banks . [SEP] [CLS] these special bonds contained a mix of investments but at their heart were supposed to be risk ##- ##free home loans , the bbc ' ##s business correspondent joe l ##yna ##m reports . [SEP] [CLS] when the housing bubble burst , the value of these assets fell sharply and the credit markets seized up . [SEP] [CLS] the balance sheets of many us and european banks , including those in the uk , became toxic and they had to be bail ##ed out by their governments . [SEP] [CLS] what jp morgan is alleged to have done was sell the mortgage ##- ##back ##ed assets knowing full well that many of the home loans were in fact very risky . [SEP] [CLS] some of the problems relate to mortgage bank washington mutual and investment bank bear ste ##arns , two failing firms that jp ##mo ##rgan took over in 2008 . [SEP] [CLS] the mortgage ##- ##back ##ed assets played a central role in the near collapse of the banking system when banks realised in 2007 that many of their assets were worth a fraction of their official book value . [SEP] [CLS] jp morgan had initially aimed to persuade justice department officials to drop the criminal investigation but
[CLS] the scale of the criminal operation has been detailed by the three sources , who say they were employed by two front ##- ##com ##pani ##es set up by a gang of professional fraud ##sters . [SEP] [CLS] the sources describe working in ` ##` call centres ' ##' in two indian cities . [SEP] [CLS] they say as many as 60 ` ##` employees ' ##' work in shifts in each office , ph ##oning talk ##talk customers and du ##ping them into giving access to their bank accounts . [SEP] [CLS] the whistle ##bl ##ower ##s say they were given a script in which they were told to claim they were calling from talk ##talk . [SEP] [CLS] they say they then convinced victims to install a computer virus . [SEP] [CLS] a separate team would use that virus to gain access to victims ' online banking , they add . [SEP] [CLS] while it has not been possible to independently verify their claims , the sources have given highly detailed accounts of the sc ##am ##mers ' tactics , which co ##rre ##late very closely with previous reports of fraud targeting talk ##talk customers . [SEP] [CLS] the software they named also matches that identified by talk ##talk in its own website guidance on what to watch out for in a sc ##am call . [SEP] [CLS] in addition , a victim of the fraud shown the call centre script has confirmed it matched the one read out to her when she was con ##ned out of # 5 ##, ##00 ##0 . [SEP] [CLS] talk ##talk was hit by a cyber ##- ##att ##ack in october 2015 , but that hack appears to be unrelated to the indian fraud . [SEP] [CLS] instead , it is alleged the sc ##am is linked to problems in a company hired by the british broadband provider . [SEP] [CLS] in 2011 , talk ##talk outs ##our ##ced some of its call ##- ##cent ##re work to the kolkata - ##lr ##b ##- calcutta - ##rr ##b ##- office of wi ##pro , one of india ' ##s largest it service companies . [SEP] [CLS] last year , three wi ##pro employees were arrested on suspicion of selling talk ##talk customer data . [SEP] [CLS] a source in kolkata , who did not want to be named , all ##ege ##s the same data was obtained by a criminal gang , with usb sticks full of data trading hands at parties . [SEP] [CLS] the criminals then used the data to operate at least three call centres , according to the whistle ##bl ##ower ##s , where staff work in shifts earning about # 120 per month to per ##pet ##rate an intricate but highly successful sc ##am .

[SEP] [CLS] john sw ##inn ##ey could sweet ##en the pill by allowing them to raise council tax - as george osborne did south of the border , allowing a 2 % council tax rise if it is to pay for social care .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it ' ##s been one of the most amazing comeback ##s ever , i think , almost in any sport but certainly in sailing and to be a part of that is a huge privilege , ' ##' said ain ##sl ##ie . [SEP] [CLS] ain ##sl ##ie combined superb ##ly with oracle ' ##s australian skipper james spit ##hill and st ##rate ##gist tom sling ##sby , another australian who won laser gold at london 2012 , to drag the syndicate back from the brink in the most remarkable turn ##around in the event ' ##s 162 ##- ##year history . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` to be perfectly honest , we had a mountain to climb , ' ##' ain ##sl ##ie added . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we knew we had to sort ourselves out .

[CLS] he was a surprise choice to lead the fifa investigation , and ru ##ffled feathers at football ' ##s governing body . [SEP] [CLS] on one occasion , he turned up una ##nn ##oun ##ced to interview members of the senior executive committee who had cast votes in the world cup bids . [SEP] [CLS] even before he dismissed fifa ' ##s report as ` ##` er ##rone ##ous ' ##' , there were signs that he was not afraid to pick a fight with his employers . [SEP] [CLS] in an interview last year he said his authority was to investigate ` ##` any official , top down , for misconduct ... no ##- ##one is above the ethics code ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] he acknowledged that he took on the investigation as an outsider . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i come into this case with no history or experience of what might have happened , ' ##' he said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i will look at the facts and my jurisdiction and make decisions on whether the ethics code was violated . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] in a recent talk to lawyers in london about ethics in sport , mr garcia said fifa ' ##s et ##hic ' ##s code needed transparency and leadership - a comment seen as a thin ##ly veil ##ed critique of fifa boss sep ##p b ##lat ##ter . [SEP] [CLS] he eventually quit fifa in december 2014 , saying that a ` ##` lack of leadership ' ##' at the organisation had led to his decision . [SEP] [CLS] mr garcia made his name in his native new york , serving as a federal prosecutor with the southern district of new york from 1992 to 2001 and working on a series of high ##- ##pro ##fi ##le cases . [SEP] [CLS] these included the prosecution of four defendants for the bombing of the world trade center in 1993 , and the investigation into the 1998 bombings of the american em ##bas ##sies in kenya and tanzania . [SEP] [CLS] he once told his daughter that his goal was ` ##` to punish people who do bad things and break the law ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] in march 2003 president george w bush appointed mr garcia , a republican , as assistant secretary for immigration and customs enforcement . [SEP] [CLS] the post put him in charge of more than 20 ##, ##00 ##0 staff and a budget of more than $ 4 ##bn . [SEP] [CLS] later he moved back to new york ' ##s southern district , serving as a us attorney from 2005 ##- ##200 ##8 .

[CLS] it was only the scots ' first match , but the history of this competition is not littered with teams who got off to losing starts and then recovered to qualify for the knockout ##s . [SEP] [CLS] some have done it , of course . [SEP] [CLS] bath and wasps did n ##' ##t just lose their opening match in this competition last season - they lost their opening two . [SEP] [CLS] and yet they both made the quarter ##- ##fin ##als . [SEP] [CLS] in the story of how they did it , we see a glimpse of what glasgow must do now in order to give themselves a chance of qualifying for that final eight . [SEP] [CLS] wasps beat cast ##res and ha ##rle ##quin ##s away from home to qualify as one of the best runners ##- ##up . [SEP] [CLS] bath beat montpellier and toulouse away - with a four ##- ##try bonus point - to make it as group winners . [SEP] [CLS] those were major victories on the road and that is now the world that glasgow have been plunged into in the wake of saturday ' ##s loss to the saints . [SEP] [CLS] the reality of european rugby hit them right between the eyes . [SEP] [CLS] the tea ##- ##lea ##ves told us that glasgow would win this . [SEP] [CLS] they had a stellar cast of international players . [SEP] [CLS] they had home advantage in the fortress of scots ##tou ##n . [SEP] [CLS] and they had some form . [SEP] [CLS] northampton had few of those things . [SEP] [CLS] they had lost three of their four games in the aviv ##a premiership , albeit by narrow margins . [SEP] [CLS] from last season ' ##s quarter ##- ##fin ##al team , they were missing the front ##- ##row of alex co ##rb ##isi ##ero , dylan hartley and sales ##i ma ##' ##af ##u , who is now on toulon ' ##s books . [SEP] [CLS] one of their go ##- ##to second ##- ##row ##s from last season , sam ##u man ##oa , has also gone to toulon and the other , courtney law ##es , is injured . [SEP] [CLS] this was a new saints pack at scots ##tou ##n and yet they were convincing winners in every department . [SEP] [CLS] glasgow had a beaten sc ##rum and had a rope ##y line ##- ##out , they were second best in the collisions and error ##- ##pro ##ne at critical times . [SEP] [CLS] warriors can get away with some of these things - and occasionally many of these things - in the more mer ##ciful environment of the pro ##12 . [SEP] [CLS] certainly not against a team as rugged as northampton , a side who spend their weekly lives engaged in dog ##fight ##s in the premiership .

[CLS] how a wine ##maker is taking on sicily ' ##s rural mafia [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s a warm july evening and the surrounding hills glow golden in the setting sun amid the chi ##rr ##up ##ing of swallows and the song of ci ##ca ##das . [SEP] [CLS] it should be an image of rural peace and content ##ment , but on closer inspection , all is not quite as it seems . [SEP] [CLS] security cameras on high stil ##ts dot the perimeter of his land . [SEP] [CLS] the metal gates leading into his winery remain securely shut throughout our interview , and inside the winery ' ##s main building , images from across his vineyard flicker on a bank of screens . [SEP] [CLS] this , he says , is what it takes to run a modern business in sicily in 2017 . [SEP] [CLS] cesare has been threatened , his land has been repeatedly tres ##pass ##ed on , his buildings have been damaged and trees cut down or set ali ##ght . [SEP] [CLS] he ' ##s even been physically attacked . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the rural mafia was trying to drive us off our land and destroy our business , ' ##' he says between careful sip ##s of wine . [SEP] [CLS] so who are the rural mafia ? [SEP] [CLS] well , they ' ##re shepherd ##s in the main - but some officials believe they ' ##re acting in ca ##hoot ##s with local lawyers , accountants and possibly even local politicians . [SEP] [CLS] cesare believes the battle against them pits modern italy against forces that want sicily to remain rooted in the ways of the past . [SEP] [CLS] driving out of his winery , he points out wooden stakes in the ground . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` they ' ##re the signs of the rural mafia ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the stakes are dotted across the land around his vineyard . [SEP] [CLS] they ' ##re about a metre ##- ##long , distinctive for the strip of white cardboard wrapped round them . [SEP] [CLS] and they ' ##re a common sight in rural sicily . [SEP] [CLS] there are more about 100 ##km - ##lr ##b ##- 60 miles - ##rr ##b ##- away from cesare ' ##s winery , in the foothills of mount et ##na , where sebastian ##o blanco is rebuilding a house on his plot of land . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` what those stakes say is ` this land belongs to us ' , ' ##' sebastian ##o says . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` they , the rural mafia , see all this land as their own , regardless of who has legal title to it .

[SEP] [CLS] the issue of ma ##kan ##i ' ##s ` ##` sponge ##bo ##b square ##pants ' ##' comes at a time when social media users in iran have been vo ##icing anger at what they see as the systematic targeting of public figures by the conservative establishment .

[SEP] [CLS] you mean to say people should not oppose anything ? [SEP] [CLS] that we no longer have the right to oppose anything ? [SEP] [CLS] that we should n ##' ##t even voice an opinion ? ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the public fur ##ore around the ma ##kan ##i case has caused a stir among the authorities who fear it could put the cultural integrity of the country in jeopardy . [SEP] [CLS] observers have suggested that to the government , ma ##kan ##i ' ##s trousers represent a step towards individuals stray ##ing from conservative religious teachings of the clergy and how islam should govern their daily lives . [SEP] [CLS] the goalkeeper ' ##s attire is only the latest example of personal expressions to have fallen foul of the establishment .

[SEP] [CLS] this week , for the first time in the 70 ##- ##year history of the un , the declared candidates will take part in public hu ##sti ##ng ##s .

[SEP] [CLS] you might say it does n ##' ##t matter . [SEP] [CLS] all those games were won .

[SEP] [CLS] how could anyone complain when england have won their past 10 six nations matches , and are about to take on a team who have n ##' ##t won in south ##- ##west london in 34 years ? [SEP] [CLS] jones , all those years of international coaching with four different nations w ##hir ##ring away in his brain , thinks otherwise . [SEP] [CLS] part of that is about standards .

[CLS] the three judges scored the 12 ##- ##rou ##nd bout 115 ##- ##11 ##2 to burns , 115 ##- ##11 ##3 to belt ##ran and 114 ##- ##11 ##4 , which did not seem to reflect belt ##ran floor ##ing burns or his di ##sl ##ocating the champion ' ##s jaw . [SEP] [CLS] brave burns was constantly pushed back and landed heavily on occasion . [SEP] [CLS] and his courage was rewarded , controversial ##ly , when he retained his belt . [SEP] [CLS] burns ' ##s preparations were unlike any of his 38 previous fights . [SEP] [CLS] his wife had given birth to their first child , his son leon ' ##s safe arrival coming only nine days ago after a four ##- ##day labour . [SEP] [CLS] the question tr ##ou ##bling his fans was what state of mind would he be in to face a challenger known for being a regular spa ##rring partner of the legendary manny pac ##qui ##ao ? [SEP] [CLS] the opening blows were fairly evenly shared , both fighters lively and aggressive , while in the second round belt ##ran had the champion pinned on the ropes for a spell , though burns managed to take most of the mexican ' ##s artillery on his arms . [SEP] [CLS] burns promised he had learned from , principally in the way he had over ##- ##st ##ret ##ched to land blows on his rec ##lining opponent , only to be caught on the counter . [SEP] [CLS] his ex ##ert ##ions in the third round , though , suggested he was still trying to blow the challenger away and he was caught several times with belt ##ran ' ##s left hook before using his ja ##b to good effect . [SEP] [CLS] belt ##ran stepped up the pace in the fourth and had burns reeling from two crunch ##ing left ##s , the second wo ##bbling the 30 ##- ##year ##- ##old from coat ##bridge . [SEP] [CLS] the challenger , two years burns ' ##s senior , was controlling the ring and he had the best of the exchanges in round five , though burns , often on the back foot , had cleared his head and was occasionally getting through the arizona ##- ##base ##d fighter ' ##s guard . [SEP] [CLS] burns continued to use the counter ##- ##att ##ack , more out of necessity than choice , to in ##flict pain on belt ##ran . [SEP] [CLS] his reward was to land two excellent shots to belt ##ran ' ##s head in the closing stages of the sixth .

[CLS] but , swift of foot and imposing in stature , oliver burke is not only far from your stereo ##typical winger , he is no ordinary 19 ##- ##year ##- ##old footballer . [SEP] [CLS] he became a fixture in new nottingham forest head coach philippe mont ##ani ##er ' ##s starting line ##- ##up this season , repay ##ing the frenchman with four goals . [SEP] [CLS] now , days before v ##ying to win his third scotland cap after being included in gordon st ##rac ##han ' ##s squad for sunday ' ##s opening world cup qualifier in malta , burke has switched to the german bundesliga after rb leipzig paid the english championship club # 13 ##m for his services . [SEP] [CLS] here ' ##s five things you should know about the teenager tipped to be the football superstar for which scotland has long been yearning . [SEP] [CLS] born in kirk ##cal ##dy on 7 april 1997 , burke was brought up in england and joined nottingham forest ' ##s youth academy at the age of eight . [SEP] [CLS] he signed a professional contract shortly before being handed his first ##- ##tea ##m debut by stuart pearce as a late substitute in a 3 ##- ##1 capital one cup defeat by tottenham hotspur on 24 september 2014 . [SEP] [CLS] a one ##- ##mont ##h loan to bradford city was to follow and two outing ##s in english league one defeats contributed to an ina ##us ##pic ##ious start to his career . [SEP] [CLS] however , on his return to forest , he gradually established himself as a fixture in the championship club ' ##s first ##- ##tea ##m squad under fellow sc ##ot doug ##ie freed ##man last season . [SEP] [CLS] with his bulging thighs and broad shoulders holding up a 6 ##ft 2 ##in frame , burke would not look out of place among the bulk ##ed ##- ##up winger ##s who these days grace the fields of top ##- ##class rugby union . [SEP] [CLS] and , by the time he scored his first forest goal in december ' ##s 1 ##- ##1 draw for cardiff city , he had elbow ##ed com ##pa ##tri ##ot and namesake chris burke out of the picture at the city ground . [SEP] [CLS] burke the elder , the former rangers , cardiff city , birmingham city and scotland winger now on trial at ki ##lma ##rno ##ck , was subsequently taking his more dim ##in ##utive frame to championship rivals rotherham united on loan before being released at the end of the season . [SEP] [CLS] burke had still featured more from the forest bench - 18 out of 31 appearances - than the starting line ##- ##up , but that did not deter st ##rac ##han from calling him into the scotland squad for the first time in march . [SEP] [CLS] st ##rac ##han has suggested it was

[SEP] [CLS] last year , c had been diagnosed with breast cancer , but had refused treatment that would ` ##` make her fat ' ##' .

[SEP] [CLS] the suicide attempt had badly damaged her liver - but with dial ##ysis , her pro ##gno ##sis would be positive . [SEP] [CLS] in a statement , c ' ##s daughter told the court : ` ##` put blunt ##ly , her life has always rev ##olved around her looks , men and material possessions . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` she understands that other people have failed relationships , feel sad and continue living , but for her , as she has said , she does n ##' ##t want to ` live in a council flat ' , ` be poor ' or ` be ugly ' , which she e ##qua ##tes with being old .

[SEP] [CLS] even a 16 ##- ##page glossy bro ##chu ##re , of the kind produced by the government , has a very ` ##` old school ' ##' feel about it . [SEP] [CLS] most of them will probably go straight in the bin , along with take ##- ##away flyers and credit card offers , say critics . [SEP] [CLS] but david cameron must feel that enough people will take a look at what the government has got to say to make it worth their while . [SEP] [CLS] he has insisted the # 9 ##m campaign is ` ##` money well spent ' ##' - a little premature perhaps , given that we do n ##' ##t know the outcome of the referendum yet . [SEP] [CLS] in fact , both sides in the debate will be entitled to a free mail ##shot once the official campaign period gets under way . [SEP] [CLS] what is causing so much controversy is that the government would not have been allowed to spend # 9 ##m on leaflets during the campaign , due to spending rules . [SEP] [CLS] so why is everyone so desperate to pepper the country with un ##rea ##d pamphlets ? [SEP] [CLS] about a third of the # 9 ##m will be spent on an online and social media campaign - but printed material is still where it is at , says philip cow ##ley , professor of politics at queen mary university of london . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` political parties would not spend millions of pounds each election putting this stuff out if it did n ##' ##t work . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it ' ##s still the main mechanism by which voters hear from political organisations . [SEP] [CLS] it dwarfs every other form of contact . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] a face ##- ##to ##- ##face chat on the doorstep was still the most effective method of converting voters to your cause , he told bbc radio 4 ' ##s the world at one , but that was time ##- ##con ##sum ##ing , so mail ##ing out leaflets was a ` ##` cheap ' ##' and ` ##` relatively easy ' ##' alternative . [SEP] [CLS] social media , he added , came a ` ##` poor third ' ##' as a tool of persuasion .

[CLS] his previous jobs were at celtic and bolton , but moving to the second tier of scottish football was no hind ##rance to him returning to work at easter road . [SEP] [CLS] lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity , and that was enough to encourage hi ##bs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the championship . [SEP] [CLS] even though his last job in scotland involved leading a team on champions league duty , lennon ' ##s mind has not been swayed by ha ##ught ##iness . [SEP] [CLS] the appointment of the former celtic manager as successor to alan stu ##bbs suits both parties , because it is mutually beneficial . [SEP] [CLS] success is all ##uring , and hi ##bs offer lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements . [SEP] [CLS] he was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club bolton , but will find stability , potential and accomplishment at easter road . [SEP] [CLS] the demand will be to deliver promotion , but that will not seem da ##unt ##ing when the majority of the squad that pushed rangers for a while last season then won the scottish cup is still in place . [SEP] [CLS] lennon ' ##s task is to ref ##ine and bo ##lster the team , when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul . [SEP] [CLS] stu ##bbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first scottish cup in 114 years , but before the final against rangers there was a tangible sense of ex ##as ##peration that promotion had been missed . [SEP] [CLS] hi ##bs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances . [SEP] [CLS] the club is about to embark on a third season in the championship , but by most other measures they can be considered a top ##- ##flight outfit . [SEP] [CLS] the budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division , the training ground at east main ##s and facilities are first ##- ##class , the football side of the business is stable and well ##- ##run by george craig , the club ' ##s head of football operations , the squad is full of talent .

[CLS] it certainly took the commodities markets - ##lr ##b ##- and me - ##rr ##b ##- rather by surprise when it agreed to cut production at a meeting in algiers . [SEP] [CLS] in fact the group has a lot of work to do before it has a real and sustained impact on the price . [SEP] [CLS] but that decision was not what the market expected . [SEP] [CLS] traders thought the result would be more di ##sar ##ray , as there was at a meeting of op ##ec and some other oil export ##ers in doha back in april . [SEP] [CLS] this time they did manage to make progress . [SEP] [CLS] the context for the algiers decision - and the unsuccessful attempts to agree action before - is crude oil prices are less than half what they were in june 2014 . [SEP] [CLS] that hurts op ##ec member countries . [SEP] [CLS] government finances and economic performance have taken a substantial hit . [SEP] [CLS] in saudi arabia for example , the government ' ##s finances were in surplus to the tune of 12 % of annual income - ##lr ##b ##- gdp - ##rr ##b ##- in 2012 . [SEP] [CLS] last year there was a deficit of 16 % . [SEP] [CLS] angola ' ##s economy grew 7 % in 2013 . [SEP] [CLS] last year it was 3 % . [SEP] [CLS] venezuela ' ##s figures are much worse , though it ' ##s far from being entirely due to the lower price of oil . [SEP] [CLS] that has however severely aggravated the economic damage done by the country ' ##s political crisis . [SEP] [CLS] op ##ec member countries have felt this financial pain with increasing intensity for almost two years now . [SEP] [CLS] op ##ec does n ##' ##t account for the whole market by a long way . [SEP] [CLS] there are very large oil producers that are not members , notably the united states , russia , china and canada . [SEP] [CLS] but the group , which currently has about 40 % of the global market can move it by cutting production - and it does have a history of responding to low oil prices , by cutting production . [SEP] [CLS] in the past saudi arabia , the group ' ##s biggest player , has often led the effort . [SEP] [CLS] this time the situation was complicated by iran ' ##s emergence earlier this year from international sanctions over its nuclear programme . [SEP] [CLS] tehran was determined to take advantage and sought to recover its share of the market . [SEP] [CLS] for op ##ec , the trouble was that saudi arabia was unwilling to curb production without iran doing likewise , a position also under ##pin ##ned by the long ##standing geo ##pol ##itical tension between the two countries which are the leading powers in the gulf .

[CLS] the group that did it has revealed scripts from upcoming movies as well as the salaries of some of the biggest stars and personal emails between employees .

[SEP] [CLS] sony ' ##s new film the interview , a comedy that features a plot to assassinate north korea ' ##s leader kim jong ##- ##un , is the reason for all this chaos . [SEP] [CLS] north korea denied being involved in the hack attack but has described it as a ` ##` righteous deed ' ##' that may have been carried out by its ` ##` supporters and sy ##mp ##athi ##ser ##s ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] sony pictures has contacted some us news outlets in an attempt to limit the damage . [SEP] [CLS] they ' ##ve asked various media sites not to publish what has been leaked by the group . [SEP] [CLS] so let ' ##s look at what we ' ##ve found out so far : [SEP] [CLS] the interview was meant to be sony ' ##s big christmas release but is now at the centre of a terror threat . [SEP] [CLS] the hacker ##s , calling themselves guardians of peace , says us cinemas which show the film can expect a ` ##` bitter fate ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] but america ' ##s department for homeland security said there ` ##` was no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theatres . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] as a result , the new york premiere of the film was cancelled and james franco and seth ro ##gen stopped doing publicity for the movie . [SEP] [CLS] sony pictures has now cancelled the planned release of the film . [SEP] [CLS] it says the majority of cinemas had decided not to show the comedy . [SEP] [CLS] so what do we know so far ? [SEP] [CLS] george cl ##oon ##ey ' ##s personal emails revealed he was personally stung by the critical reaction to his film the monuments men .

[CLS] but there are about 500 deaths a year in the uk from cardiac arrest among the under ##- ##30 ##s . [SEP] [CLS] when it happens it is shocking .

[SEP] [CLS] he is said to be one of the fit ##test players at his club , bolton wanderers . [SEP] [CLS] the same sentiments were expressed about marc ##- ##vi ##vie ##n foe , the cameroon footballer who collapsed and died during an international match in 2003 . [SEP] [CLS] but the underlying cause of such deaths are likely to be inherited rather than a reflection on their fitness . [SEP] [CLS] genetic abnormalities are usually associated with ar ##rh ##yt ##hmi ##as - irregular heart beats - or card ##iom ##yo ##path ##ies , which is a disease of the heart muscle . [SEP] [CLS] but where sport can play a role is on the likelihood of these conditions leading to a cardiac arrest . [SEP] [CLS] the evidence is not clear ##- ##cut . [SEP] [CLS] but research has suggested that those with inherited conditions are twice as likely to suffer a cardiac arrest if they play sport at a high level . [SEP] [CLS] dr leonard shapiro , a consultant card ##iol ##ogist and medical adviser to the football association , says it is always difficult to know exactly what triggers the attack . [SEP] [CLS] but he says : ` ##` there is a pre ##dis ##position in some individuals to have a cardiac event under very high physical and emotional stress . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the question that is always asked after such events is whether anything can be done to prevent them . [SEP] [CLS] many sports in britain regularly screen top athletes , although it is not mandatory as it is in some countries such as italy . [SEP] [CLS] in football , players are checked at 16 and then are likely to have regular check ##- ##ups as their career goes on . [SEP] [CLS] those that are diagnosed with a problem often have to give up top ##- ##lev ##el sport . [SEP] [CLS] sports card ##iol ##ogist sanjay sharma , who also works for the charity cardiac risk in the young , says the tests are thorough , but not perfect . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it involves taking a history relating to cardiac symptoms , which include chest pain during ex ##ert ##ion or breath which is di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ate to the amount of exercise being performed , and blackout ##s , and asking about a family history because many of these conditions that can cause cardiac arrest are hereditary .

[CLS] media playback is not supported on this device [SEP] [CLS] ali crawford missed a hat ##- ##trick of chances for acc ##ies in the first half while kill ##ie ' ##s kris boyd twice headed wide from close range .

[SEP] [CLS] boyd fired into the net after connecting with an adam fr ##iz ##zell shot but the striker was flag ##ged offs ##ide as both sides had to settle for a point . [SEP] [CLS] there was a familiarity about the manner in which acc ##ies enjoyed periods of dominance and yet failed to capital ##ise .

[SEP] [CLS] and though a point away from home might prove valuable in the final analysis , a win would certainly have been more welcome . [SEP] [CLS] acc ##ies were cu ##lp ##able of a lack of composure and accuracy in front of goal , with the normally reliable crawford sk ##ew ##ing shots wide or hitting tame ##ly into the keeper ' ##s arms . [SEP] [CLS] ra ##kis ##h bingham missed arguably the chance of the match when he headed wide of goal from inside the six ##- ##yard box . [SEP] [CLS] but acc ##ies were not the only team guilty of prof ##liga ##cy in front of goal . [SEP] [CLS] ki ##lma ##rno ##ck - and boyd - in particular passed up good chances , with the striker heading off target from good positions on a couple of occasions . [SEP] [CLS] he was also caught offs ##ide far too often , notably when tapping fr ##iz ##zell ' ##s shot into the net . [SEP] [CLS] when the strikers did find their shooting boots , both keepers earned their corn with some excellent saves . [SEP] [CLS] woods kept out a controlled co ##uli ##bal ##y volley and also denied fr ##iz ##zell late in the game , with the ki ##lma ##rno ##ck substitute making a good impression from the bench .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` wales saw a trim ##ming of training numbers in 2011 ##/ ##12 compared to the previous year . [SEP] [CLS] it is for this reason , and the fall in mid ##wife numbers there , that the rc ##m is putting wales on watch , ' ##' the report said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we are not yet ringing the alarm bell , but we are poised to do so ; decision ##- ##makers in wales must turn this deteriorating situation around .

' ##' [SEP] [CLS] mid ##wife numbers fell in wales in the last annual survey in 2011 , where figures were 12 % lower than in 2008 , and the rc ##m said it was the third year in a row in which the number of mid ##wives working in the nhs in wales was cut .

[SEP] [CLS] but it did not expect house prices in the capital to continue to see above average growth next year , pointing to the fact that property was becoming una ##ff ##ord ##able for many in the city .

[CLS] it works by looking for a combination of ` ##` markers ' ##' in the blood which are different in healthy people and those with the disease . [SEP] [CLS] delegates at the alzheimer ' ##s research uk conference heard that the university of nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics . [SEP] [CLS] it could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments , they said . [SEP] [CLS] the test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with alzheimer ' ##s disease , such as amy ##loid and ap ##oe . [SEP] [CLS] but through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease , as well as those with early ##- ##sta ##ge memory problems , the researchers detected some other markers that were suggest ##ive of the disease . [SEP] [CLS] most notably , some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test . [SEP] [CLS] prof kevin morgan from the university of nottingham said they still had to valid ##ate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients . [SEP] [CLS] but he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with alzheimer ' ##s using a blood test . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` as blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis , we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] he said there were several ways the test could benefit patients , including giving people a definitive diagnosis , which was not always possible at the moment . [SEP] [CLS] it could also direct future the ##ra ##pies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment , he explained . [SEP] [CLS] potentially , it could be a ` ##` cheap and easy pre ##- ##screen ' ##' test which enabled alzheimer ' ##s to be picked up before symptoms appeared , he said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the way we see it working is you can test people and it will tell them if they have the all ##- ##cle ##ar , or if they are medium - or high ##- ##ris ##k . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` if they are medium ##- ##ris ##k , they can be monitored closely and high ##- ##ris ##k patients can be referred to a specialist for more in ##- ##de ##pt ##h testing .

[CLS] the cost of borrowing will remain unchanged at 6 ##. ##25 % ahead of a possible increase in us interest rates later this month .

[SEP] [CLS] the bbc was one of several media organisations prevented from attending the briefing . [SEP] [CLS] the central bank blamed a decision to move the press conference to a small venue .

[CLS] writing in pl ##os one they say the gene fault may encourage the formation of blood cl ##ots - the ultimate cause of most heart attacks and strokes . [SEP] [CLS] scientists hope gene tests may help doctors one day to pin ##point individuals more likely to suffer these conditions . [SEP] [CLS] but experts say lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise have the greatest influence on risk . [SEP] [CLS] around one in 10 people in the caucasian population carries this variation of the gene , named pia ##2 . [SEP] [CLS] and researchers from king ' ##s college london reviewed more than 80 studies involving about 50 ##, ##00 ##0 people - the largest analysis of this genetic fault to date . [SEP] [CLS] they found individuals with pia ##2 were more likely to have a stroke - caused by a blood cl ##ot blocking blood supply to the brain - than those without the gene . [SEP] [CLS] scientists calculate the gene increases a person ' ##s risk of having a stroke by 10 ##- ##15 % . [SEP] [CLS] but how significant this increase is depends on an individual ' ##s baseline risk - influenced by factors such as smoking , diet , weight and exercise , the scientists say . [SEP] [CLS] and for people with two copies of the gene the risk rises by up to 70 % from this baseline . [SEP] [CLS] in a second study published in the same journal , the scientists show pia ##2 is also linked to an increased risk of heart attacks in people under 45 . [SEP] [CLS] more research is needed to see whether this holds true for the whole population , they say . [SEP] [CLS] about 150 ##, ##00 ##0 people have a stroke in the uk each year and more than 100 ##, ##00 ##0 heart attacks are recorded annually . [SEP] [CLS] both th ##rom ##bot ##ic strokes - ##lr ##b ##- the most common kind - ##rr ##b ##- and heart attacks are caused by block ##age of blood vessels in the heart and brain - ultimately through the formation of cl ##ots . [SEP] [CLS] the faulty gene appears to affect a protein called g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein iii ##a - present on plate ##lets , natural cl ##otti ##ng cells in the blood . [SEP] [CLS] plate ##lets help trigger the formation of cl ##ots to stop bleeding after injury . [SEP] [CLS] but scientists say carrying the gene may render them over ##active . [SEP] [CLS] they caution that overall the genes play a smaller role in risk than more established factors , such as high blood pressure and obesity .

[CLS] members of the nas ##uw ##t , meeting in bournemouth , criticised a loosen ##ing of the rules on who schools can employ to teach children . [SEP] [CLS] the government says the changes allow schools to hire talented people and the vast majority of teachers will continue to have the recognised qualification . [SEP] [CLS] but the union says it is about saving money . [SEP] [CLS] one delegate told the conference children were being taught ` ##` on the cheap ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] last year the government relaxed the rules in england on employing teachers for academies . [SEP] [CLS] the semi ##- ##ind ##ep ##end ##ent state schools are now allowed to employ teachers who have not qualified as teachers , bringing them in to line with the situation in free schools and private schools . [SEP] [CLS] in other state ##- ##fu ##nded schools , people employed as teachers have to have passed the relevant qualification - known as qualified teacher status - ##lr ##b ##- q ##ts - ##rr ##b ##- . [SEP] [CLS] at the time , the government said the change would allow schools to bring in talented professionals such as scientists , musicians and university professors , plus experienced teachers and heads from overseas and the independent sector . [SEP] [CLS] schools are also allowed to employ people called ` ##` instructors ' ##' who have particular - usually vocational - skills but do not have q ##ts , and the rules governing when they can be hired were relaxed last september . [SEP] [CLS] the nas ##uw ##t says the changes mean less ##- ##qual ##ified people are being put in charge of classes - and are being paid less than teachers . [SEP] [CLS] it has published a survey of its members which found six out of ten of those who replied said un ##qual ##ified staff were being used in their schools and that most said un ##qual ##ified staff were teaching lessons . [SEP] [CLS] it asked for views from 2 ##, ##30 ##0 of its members online earlier this month . [SEP] [CLS] chris ke ##ates , general secretary of the union , said : ` ##` the extent of the secretary of state ' ##s decision to remove the en ##ti ##tlement of children and young people to be taught by a qualified teacher can now be seen .

[CLS] the clashes , between sunni pro ##- and anti ##- ##sy ##rian groups , followed the shooting dead on sunday of two anti ##- ##sy ##rian cleric ##s . [SEP] [CLS] the violence is the first in beirut since the conflict began in neighbouring syria in march last year . [SEP] [CLS] the bbc ' ##s jim muir in beirut says the incident shows how divided the lebanese are over the syrian crisis . [SEP] [CLS] it follows a week of clashes in the northern city of tripoli between anti ##- ##sy ##rian sunni ##s and ala ##wi ##tes who support the regime of syrian president basha ##r al ##- ##ass ##ad . [SEP] [CLS] syrian and lebanese politics have been deeply inter ##twined throughout the history of the two states . [SEP] [CLS] syria , the dominant partner , had a large military presence in lebanon for 29 years , finally withdrawing soldiers in 2005 , but maintaining a strong influence . [SEP] [CLS] political factions in lebanon have often defined themselves as pro ##- or anti ##- ##sy ##rian . [SEP] [CLS] by jim muir ##bb ##c news , beirut [SEP] [CLS] given how deeply and sharply lebanon is divided over syria , it ' ##s a miracle that there has n ##' ##t been much more violence than there has . [SEP] [CLS] but the killing of two sunni cleric ##s at a lebanese army checkpoint in the north of the country on sunday could hardly pass without consequence - though the fallout could have been much greater . [SEP] [CLS] only in beirut did the tension break into open conflict . [SEP] [CLS] and it was restricted to a clash between sunni groups , with the mainstream future faction of sa ##ad al ##- ##hari ##ri using the occasion to squeeze out the small , pro ##- ##sy ##rian arab movement party , whose leader shake ##r be ##r ##ja ##wi fled . [SEP] [CLS] in nearby areas of south beirut , hezbollah - the most powerful force in the land - kept well out of it . [SEP] [CLS] political and religious leaders from all sides urged restraint , while the government pledged a vigorous en ##qui ##ry into the death of the two sha ##ikh ##s . [SEP] [CLS] divisions over syria are the defining issue in lebanese politics . [SEP] [CLS] everybody knows how real the danger is that the country would be torn apart if those differences are allowed to er ##upt freely onto the streets . [SEP] [CLS] sunday ' ##s violence was triggered by the shooting dead of two sunni sheikh ##s linked to the anti ##- ##sy ##rian future movement , headed by opposition leader sa ##ad al ##- ##hari ##ri , at a lebanese army checkpoint in the north on sunday . [SEP] [CLS] supporters of mr hari ##ri responded by blocking main roads with burning car tyres , but security forces intervened to clear them .

[CLS] scientists have struggled to explain the so ##- ##cal ##led pause that began in 1999 , despite ever increasing levels of co ##2 in the atmosphere . [SEP] [CLS] the latest theory says that a naturally occurring 30 ##- ##year cycle in the atlantic ocean is behind the slow ##down . [SEP] [CLS] the researchers says this slow ##- ##mo ##ving current could continue to divert heat into the deep seas for another decade . [SEP] [CLS] however , they caution that global temperatures are likely to increase rapidly when the cycle flip ##s to a warmer phase . [SEP] [CLS] according to the inter ##go ##vern ##mental panel on climate change - ##lr ##b ##- ip ##cc - ##rr ##b ##- , global average temperatures have increased by around 0 ##. ##0 ##5 c per decade in the period between 1998 and 2012 . [SEP] [CLS] this compares with a dec ##ada ##l average of 0 ##. ##12 between 1951 and 2012 . [SEP] [CLS] more than a dozen theories have been put forward on the cause of this pause in temperature growth that occurred while emissions of carbon dioxide were at record highs . [SEP] [CLS] these ideas include the impact of pollution such as soo ##t particles that have reflected back some of the sun ' ##s heat into space . [SEP] [CLS] increased volcanic activity since 2000 has also been blamed , as have variations in solar activity . [SEP] [CLS] the most recent perspectives have looked to the oceans as the locations of the missing heat . [SEP] [CLS] last year a study suggested that a periodic up ##well ##ing of cooler waters in the pacific was limiting the rise . [SEP] [CLS] however this latest work , published in the journal science , shifts the focus from the pacific to the atlantic and southern oceans . [SEP] [CLS] the team , lead by prof ka ##- ##kit tung from the university of washington , us , says there is now evidence that a 30 ##- ##year current alternately warm ##s and cool ##s the world by sinking large amounts of heat beneath these deep waters . [SEP] [CLS] they ' ##ve used observations from a network of devices called ar ##go floats that sample the oceans down to 2 ##, ##00 ##0 metres . [SEP] [CLS] the researchers say that there was another hiatus between 1945 and 1975 due to this current taking down the heat , that led to fears of a new ice age . [SEP] [CLS] from 1976 though , the cycle flipped and contributed to the warming of the world , as more heat stayed on the surface . [SEP] [CLS] but since the year 2000 , the heat has been going deeper , and the world ' ##s overall temperatures have n ##' ##t risen beyond the record set in 1998 .

[CLS] in a study of more than 70 ##, ##00 ##0 women , opt ##imi ##sts were less likely to get fatal cancer , heart disease , lung conditions and stroke in their retirement years .

[SEP] [CLS] a significantly lowered risk was seen for deaths from a number of causes , including heart disease , stroke , cancer , respiratory disease and infection over the course of the study period .

[CLS] the welsh government wants to remove the legal defence for parents who use corporal punishment to discipline children . [SEP] [CLS] but campaign ##ers said removing the reasonable cha ##stis ##ement defence would leave ` ##` ordinary parents facing jail ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] the welsh government said it would make sure the law made ` ##` life better for parents and children ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] it is due to consult on the plans in the next 12 months . [SEP] [CLS] now a group of parents , known as be reasonable wales , have started a petition calling on the welsh government to scrap the plans .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` if the government ca n ##' ##t tell the difference then they should n ##' ##t be passing laws about it . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the move would mean if an all ##ega ##tion of hitting a child is made against an adult , it would remove a defence for those who might argue they had not realised they had hit the child so hard . [SEP] [CLS] andy james , chairman of children are un ##beat ##able , a campaign group in favour of a smack ##ing ban , accused the group of ` ##` scare ##mon ##ger ##ing ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] he said the law had been changed to give children the same protection against assault as adults in 52 countries and there was no evidence parents would be criminal ##ised by the move . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` no ##- ##one has a right to hit another person , or to punish and control them , ' ##' he told bbc radio wales .

[CLS] football supporters submitted a freedom of information request to obtain the ten ##ancy agreement amid claims the london legacy development corporation - ##lr ##b ##- ll ##dc - ##rr ##b ##- would sub ##si ##dis ##e the rent .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` brad ' ##s drumming was the powerhouse behind the specials and it was seen as a key part to the two tone sound . [SEP] [CLS] he was much respected in the world of drumming and his style of reggae and ska was seen as genuinely ground ##- ##break ##ing when the specials first hit the charts in 1979 .

[CLS] i ' ##m not sure that is the right description for the 2016 us election campaign , but some variation on that must come close - maybe instead of ` greatest ' we could have weird ##est , most compelling , unpredictable , disturbing , hate ##- ##fi ##lled , bizarre . [SEP] [CLS] maybe all of those things - and a few more besides . [SEP] [CLS] i spoke to a producer in london the other day and he asked whether i could incorporate into my tv piece the stand ##out moments of the campaign .

[SEP] [CLS] a thousand different jaw ##- ##drop ##ping episodes . [SEP] [CLS] as i start writing this - ##lr ##b ##- it ' ##s sunday afternoon - ##rr ##b ##- the fbi director has just sought to wade out of the us election , having wade ##d in 10 days earlier in the most astonishing fashion . [SEP] [CLS] so having sent the most un ##bel ##ie ##va ##bly opaque letter that there might be a w ##hiff ... he now says there is n ##' ##t . [SEP] [CLS] but what an astonishing state of affairs . [SEP] [CLS] james come ##y ' ##s letter breathed new life into the trump campaign , and who knows how many senate races he ' ##s affected where early voting is taking place . [SEP] [CLS] why did he write the letter in the first place ? [SEP] [CLS] what was he hoping to achieve ? [SEP] [CLS] what did he assess the fallout would be ? [SEP] [CLS] and ultimately why put the fbi in the middle of the election when they are now trying to back out ? [SEP] [CLS] and yes , i know i ' ##ve already used that word in this paragraph . [SEP] [CLS] but this election day blog is not about the fbi - more a way of highlighting how at every turn there have been incidents that just bog ##gle , confuse and occasionally fry the brain . [SEP] [CLS] well there are the obvious ones - donald trump describing mexican ##s as thieves and rap ##ists , him mocking a disabled person , di ##spar ##aging pow ##s , wanting to ban all muslims . [SEP] [CLS] there were the ones that made me laugh . [SEP] [CLS] yes , i just laughed when i read a news ##fl ##ash saying the pope goes to war with donald trump over his plan to build a wall .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` derek ' ##s doing everything he can , extract ##ing every ounce out of the club , ' ##' thompson told bbc scotland . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i thought last summer , could they achieve more than they had done , was it maybe the right time for derek to go , what else could he do with this aberdeen team ? [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` he ' ##s come up trump ##s again . [SEP] [CLS] if anything , they ' ##ve been better than they were last season . [SEP] [CLS] with rangers in the league , with a stronger hearts team , they ' ##ve still been the second ##- ##top team in scotland and i think derek and his players deserve enormous credit for that . [SEP] [CLS] media playback is not supported on this device [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` even if rangers were to win - ##lr ##b ##- on sunday - ##rr ##b ##- , i do n ##' ##t think they will finish second .

[SEP] [CLS] to reach both cup finals would be success in itself , to finish second , to get european football again , to break records - i ' ##m not sure what else he can do . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the consistency they ' ##ve shown in the last two seasons has been phenomena ##l .

[SEP] [CLS] some say he simply could n ##' ##t resist the opportunity for an image that will undoubtedly appear in newspapers around the world tomorrow morning . [SEP] [CLS] and that ' ##s in keeping with the real spirit of this event , because this is all about public relations . [SEP] [CLS] the indian government ' ##s new ##- ##fo ##und enthusiasm for yoga can be traced directly back to mr mod ##i . [SEP] [CLS] he ' ##s already created a ministry of yoga with its own dedicated yoga minister , and his personal intervention is said to have been decisive in per ##su ##ading the un to designate june 21st as world yoga day .

[SEP] [CLS] it is india ' ##s second greatest gift to the world after the number zero , according to mr mod ##i ' ##s pr machine .

[SEP] [CLS] the government quickly stripped out anything that could be described as ` ##` hindu ' ##' from today ' ##s event in response to these criticisms , pu ##rg ##ing the om chant and sun sal ##utation ##s from the menu . [SEP] [CLS] but mr mod ##i has recognised that yoga can do more for india than just encourage health and happiness through regular exercise . [SEP] [CLS] the indian prime minister has always had a talent for publicity and he has spotted that with yoga india has a unique ` ##` brand ' ##' that can deliver huge economic benefits for the country .

[SEP] [CLS] cold ##s and flu can often be dealt with there , without bothering a gp at all , while some even provide stop smoking services and pre ##scribe drugs and treatments .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` yet people still do n ##' ##t really know who we are and what we can do . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] he says the aim of the campaign is to ` ##` challenge the traditional view of ph ##arm ##acies as simply di ##sp ##ense ##rs of medicine ' ##' so that they are seen as a place where illness can be treated and good health promoted . [SEP] [CLS] the push has received the backing of gps with both the royal college of gps and nhs alliance , which represents community services , putting their names to the campaign .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i just kind of want to be honest with people , ' ##' he said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i do n ##' ##t want anyone to think that i have a hidden agenda . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] mr var ##ad ##kar has court ##ed controversy by announcing that people convicted of welfare fraud will be ` ##` named and shame ##d ' ##' on a government website . [SEP] [CLS] in a recent speech reported by the irish independent , he outlined his attitude to br ##ex ##it , saying there should be ` ##` no economic border at all between north and south ' ##' .

[CLS] both jenny rat ##h ##bone and mike hedges are applying separately to take part in a ballot which , if they win , will allow them to propose a bill to ban the fees . [SEP] [CLS] mr hedges said the fees were a ` ##` tax ' ##' on some of society ' ##s poor ##est with students among the biggest hit . [SEP] [CLS] but one letting agent said a ban could hit efforts to professional ##ise the sector . [SEP] [CLS] the welsh government said it was happy to consider how such legislation might work . [SEP] [CLS] the charges have already been banned in scotland , while the uk government is planning to consult on doing the same in england . [SEP] [CLS] there are currently no firm plans to do the same in wales , although the welsh government has said it was ` ##` actively considering ' ##' the move . [SEP] [CLS] ministers have faced criticism for not acting sooner . [SEP] [CLS] am ##s from all of the assembly ' ##s opposition parties have supported a ban . [SEP] [CLS] assembly members can propose bills - proposals for new laws which when passed by the assembly become acts - from outside the government through a random ballot process . [SEP] [CLS] mr hedges said : ` ##` they are a tax on some of the poor ##est people in society who are engaged in private rented accommodation . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the swansea east am said it was a big problem in university cities and a ` ##` big problem anywhere where there is more demand for housing then there is housing ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] mr hedges believes that about 20 am ##s may apply to take part in the ballot - although only mr hedges and ms rat ##h ##bone are currently known to be proposing banning the fees . [SEP] [CLS] cardiff council am jenny rat ##h ##bone said mr hedges ' attempt ` ##` doubles the chances of one of us being picked ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] catherine ian ##nu ##cci , 21 , originally from barry and studying her third year of history and politics at cardiff university , lives in a house with six other tenants . [SEP] [CLS] she said they have had to pay [UNK] # 80 each to take the home off the market - amount ##ing to a fee of [UNK] # 560 for the agency . [SEP] [CLS] ms ian ##nu ##cci , who is a part of the group labour students and has conducted research on agency fees for ms rat ##h ##bone , said : ` ##` it ' ##s a significant amount of money . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we do n ##' ##t really know what they ' ##re for and we do n ##' ##t know what that ' ##s gone towards . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] she also had to pay
[CLS] one met police officer received an overtime payment of # 45 ##, ##00 ##0 last year , a freedom of information request found . [SEP] [CLS] the overtime bill for officers and staff in england and wales total ##led almost # 1b ##n over three years and went up by # 6 ##m last year . [SEP] [CLS] the home office said the government had ` ##` already taken steps to reduce unnecessary overtime payments ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we have asked the independent police re ##mun ##eration review body to consider whether more can be done on this issue , ' ##' said a spokesman . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` police officers ' pay should reflect the difficult work they do - but the public right ##ly expects that this is not abused . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the national police chiefs ' council said it was ` ##` only right ' ##' that officers should be compensated for overtime . [SEP] [CLS] by danny shaw , bbc home affairs correspondent [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` overtime does not go sick or take leave . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] that pit ##hy phrase , from tim god ##win , the former metropolitan police deputy commissioner , sums up the useful ##ness of overtime to a service that has to cope with sudden and unexpected events . [SEP] [CLS] whether it ' ##s the surveillance officer monitoring a terrorism suspect , the detective constable deployed on a murder investigation , or the civilian staff employee answering calls after hours because a colleague has gone home ill - overtime has a valuable part to play . [SEP] [CLS] sir tom wins ##or ' ##s review recognised that , while also recommend ##ing changes designed to reduce the overall bill . [SEP] [CLS] the year ##- ##on ##- ##year increase , identified by 5 live ' ##s research , does not mean that work has stalled . [SEP] [CLS] but it ' ##s interesting to note that some overtime payments appear to be connected to staff shortages . [SEP] [CLS] as the police workforce shrink ##s further , it may well be that existing officers and staff are increasingly asked to plug the gaps . [SEP] [CLS] figures for 39 forces in england and wales show the overtime bill rose from # 307 ##. ##1 m in 2013 ##/ ##14 to # 313 ##. ##2 m in 2014 ##/ ##15 . [SEP] [CLS] the metropolitan police accounted for about a third of the overall bill , while in two other forces , bedfordshire and cleveland , the overtime bill went up by 50 % - explained in part by gaps in recruitment . [SEP] [CLS] the met said officers earning the highest amounts were in specialist roles , where working time was determined by the operational circumstances . [SEP] [CLS] an officer at west midlands police earned # 32 ##, ##70 ##2 in overtime working in a contact centre
[CLS] intense negotiations are under way between political parties amid public anger at a one ##- ##off levy of up to 10 % being imposed on save ##rs . [SEP] [CLS] president nico ##s anastasia ##des said refusing the bail ##out would have led to the collapse of the country ' ##s banks . [SEP] [CLS] the speaker of the european parliament has called for the levy to be revised to protect small ##- ##sca ##le bank customers . [SEP] [CLS] the 10 ##bn ##- ##eur ##o - ##lr ##b ##- $ 13 ##bn ; [UNK] # 8 ##. ##6 bn - ##rr ##b ##- deal agreed by the eu and im ##f in brussels marks a radical departure from previous international aid packages . [SEP] [CLS] under its terms , people in cyprus with less than 100 ##, ##00 ##0 euros in their accounts would have to pay a one ##- ##time tax of 6 ##. ##75 % . [SEP] [CLS] those with sums over that threshold would pay 9 ##. ##9 % in tax . [SEP] [CLS] deposit ##ors will be compensated with the equivalent amount in shares in their banks . [SEP] [CLS] it is believed that euro ##zone leaders , particularly in germany , insisted on the levy because of the large amount of russian capital kept in cypriot banks , amid fears of money ##- ##lau ##nder ##ing . [SEP] [CLS] president anastasia ##des , who was elected only last month , is due to address the country shortly - ##lr ##b ##- from 18 ##: ##00 gm ##t - ##rr ##b ##- . [SEP] [CLS] he said in a statement earlier that cyprus had had to choose between the ` ##` catastrophic scenario of disorder ##ly bankruptcy or the scenario of a painful but controlled management of the crisis ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] the president has been meeting with members of the parliament ' ##s finance committee , his office said . [SEP] [CLS] on saturday the head of the committee , nicholas papa ##do ##poulos , expressed shock at the deal , saying it was ` ##` much worse than expected ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] the president ' ##s democratic rally party - which has 20 seats in the 56 ##- ##me ##mber assembly - needs support from other factions to rat ##ify the bail ##out . [SEP] [CLS] a spokesman for one of its coalition partners , the democratic party , told bbc news they wanted assurance ##s that the deal would resolve the problems facing cyprus before voting in favour . [SEP] [CLS] opposition leader george lil ##lika ##s , an independent , said the president had ` ##` betrayed the people ' ##s vote ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] the speaker of the european parliament , martin sc ##hul ##z , argued in a newspaper interview that there should be an exemption from the levy for save ##rs , for example , who had less than 25 ##,

[CLS] but reaction time is a bit of an unusual commission that left me , as producer , staring at a half ##- ##ho ##ur gap in the schedule and wondering what would fill it . [SEP] [CLS] it is the network ' ##s first programme made entirely on smartphone ##s . [SEP] [CLS] the premise was simple on paper . [SEP] [CLS] bbc radio 4 put a prompt on social media ahead of valentine ' ##s day : ` ##` tell us a story about love , ' ##' inviting anyone in the world to make a two ##- ##min ##ute voice recording of their relationship story , on their phone , and email it in as an attachment . [SEP] [CLS] then , i would knit the contributions into a half ##- ##ho ##ur of online dates , first loves , and bitter break ##- ##ups . [SEP] [CLS] i will confess to some nerves . [SEP] [CLS] until recently , the quality from mobile recordings would not be good enough - but , in my day job as a journalist , i have used the technique when we have not been able to get an interview ##ee to a studio . [SEP] [CLS] the technology has improved massive ##ly in recent years and is often comparable to a traditional recording . [SEP] [CLS] as the process started , there were anxious days when nothing arrived , and , then , suddenly - a brilliant an ##ec ##dote . [SEP] [CLS] - ##lr ##b ##- caroline ' ##s wedding gets der ##ailed [UNK] $ ¦ - ##rr ##b ##- [SEP] [CLS] i would ref ##resh the in ##box open ##- ##mouth ##ed at relationship stories that could not be broadcast ; weed ##ing out information about people ' ##s ex ##es that could get me sued , and in one instance , deciding against broadcasting an entertaining but detailed account of what happens when you get d ##yse ##nte ##ry on honeymoon . [SEP] [CLS] the other factor that gave me a few worries was that people seemed particularly keen to share their disasters - marital break ##- ##up , hated ex ##es , a ruined wedding , loneliness , a complete inability to pull - was there anyone with a nice , romantic story ? [SEP] [CLS] it turned out there was , and it was from a woman called samantha . [SEP] [CLS] her tale finishes the programme , and it is a bit of a jaw ##- ##drop ##per . [SEP] [CLS] i knew i had something when i played it to a reasonably hard ##- ##bit ##ten reporter at the next desk and she cried . [SEP] [CLS] one of the key decisions about the programme was that if we were handing over half an hour to radio 4 ' ##s listeners , we should go the whole hog and get one of them to present it . [SEP] [CLS] so a few weeks
[CLS] there are around 200 suicide ##s a year of people cared for by crisis teams - three times the number in hospitals . [SEP] [CLS] a third had been discharged from hospital in the previous fort ##night , while a further third had been using the service for less than a week . [SEP] [CLS] the university of manchester report suggests crisis teams in the uk are under too much pressure . [SEP] [CLS] crisis resolution ##/ ##hom ##e treatment - ##lr ##b ##- cr ##ht - ##rr ##b ##- teams are made up of psychiatrist ##s , mental health nurses , social workers and support workers . [SEP] [CLS] they visit patients in their homes , administering medication and offering psychological and practical support . [SEP] [CLS] by michael buchanan , bbc social affairs correspondent [SEP] [CLS] twenty years ago , there was a broad consensus within the nhs that suicide ##s among psychiatric patients were inevitable . [SEP] [CLS] the landscape has now changed . [SEP] [CLS] med ##ics in detroit proved that you could cut out all suicide ##s and now the more innovative parts of the nhs are trying to embark on a similar exercise . [SEP] [CLS] but reaching that goal requires a culture change . [SEP] [CLS] not just to appreciate that it is possible , but to invest in the training and other resources that will make it possible . [SEP] [CLS] too often , in ##patient beds have been cut with the nhs promising the savings will be invested in community services . [SEP] [CLS] twenty years of research , with ever increasing suicide ##s under the care of crisis teams , shows that simply has n ##' ##t happened . [SEP] [CLS] too many psychiatric patients are still simply being failed . [SEP] [CLS] one other important point this research highlights - those nhs trusts that involve families in investigating deaths improve performance . [SEP] [CLS] why some trusts fail to do so , or engage in some token ##istic efforts , is utterly ba ##ff ##ling . [SEP] [CLS] the national confidential inquiry into suicide and homicide by people with mental illness - ##lr ##b ##- nc ##ish - ##rr ##b ##- report suggests the teams are bearing the pressure of caring for patients who actually need a more acute level of care , such as in ##patient beds . [SEP] [CLS] it said crisis teams had become the ` ##` default option ' ##' in acute care ` ##` used for too many patients at high risk ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] prof louis apple ##by , director of nc ##ish , said : ` ##` our findings suggest that we are accepting too much risk in the home treatment these teams offer and that the crisis team is now the priority for suicide prevention in mental health . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the report suggests people who live alone - as 43 % of those who committed
[CLS] the historic walled market town is popular with overseas visitors , but if they arrive in a left ##- ##hand drive coach at the drop ##- ##off point , they have to step out into moving traffic . [SEP] [CLS] the drop ##- ##off point could be widened to provide a walkway on the right side for foreign ##- ##re ##gist ##ered coaches . [SEP] [CLS] residents have expressed concerns coaches are avoiding the town . [SEP] [CLS] the work would cost [UNK] # 85 ##, ##9 ##10 . [SEP] [CLS] a report by marianne jackson , con ##wy council ' ##s head of community development service , says : ` ##` the existing coach drop off and pick up point in con ##wy is well located from a passenger point of view , but presents a growing road safety risk with the lack of separation from the flow of traffic through the town centre . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` this risk is amplified as we strive to increase the market share of continental visitors to con ##wy , as any overseas visitors arriving by continental coach when entering or di ##se ##mba ##rkin ##g will be on the off ##- ##side of the coach . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` this means that , without a foot ##way on the off ##- ##side of the coach , they do so into and from the adjacent live carriage ##way , thus presenting a considerable road safety hazard . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] deputy mayor of con ##wy , bill chapman said : ` ##` if it ' ##s a bus from another country , from france , from germany , people can get off and walk straight into the traffic so there is a danger to our visitors . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we need our visitors here in this town and we do n ##' ##t want to have them killed on the streets of con ##wy . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] toby tun ##sta ##ll , chairman of con ##wy chamber of trade said the work was much needed . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it can be quite frightening , ' ##' he told bbc wales . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we see people getting off coaches and going straight across the road with traffic driving pass . [SEP] [CLS] getting back on the coach , they will cross the road with cars coming across their path . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we need the coach trade to keep the tourist industry in con ##wy going . [SEP] [CLS] the foreign visitors at the moment in particular are really keeping us going at a quiet time of year . [SEP] [CLS] these improvements are a really good idea .

[CLS] but every so often , a family walks by carrying bags and suitcase ##s , not quite sure where they will be living in the next few weeks . [SEP] [CLS] urged to evacuate the nearby tower blocks overnight , they have come to the centre after a chaotic night of mixed messages in a bid to get their questions answered . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` why ca n ##' ##t they stay in their flats ? [SEP] [CLS] where will they be moved to ? [SEP] [CLS] and how long will it take for life to get back to normal ? ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] those questions and dozens of others are being asked by the residents of 650 flats in camden who were evacuated at short notice from their homes over fire safety concerns , following the gr ##en ##fell tower blaze nine days earlier . [SEP] [CLS] the local council says it will remove external thermal clad ##ding from five tower blocks on the cha ##lco ##ts estate - and that , after taking advice from the fire service , it had no option but to ask the residents of four of those blocks to move out temporarily . [SEP] [CLS] many occupants feel like the evacuation is an over ##rea ##ction and firmly believe they could stay in their flats while the re ##media ##l work takes place . [SEP] [CLS] laura mu ##lc ##ah ##y , 29 , is holding a sheet that confirms she has registered her grandparents , eileen , 71 , and william , 75 , to be re ##house ##d from the do ##rney block . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it ' ##s a joke , ' ##' she says . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` no ##- ##one knows what is going on . [SEP] [CLS] my grand ##ad is still in there .

[CLS] they found that targeting a part of the brain called the par ##ie ##tal lobe improved the ability of volunteers to solve numerical problems . [SEP] [CLS] they hope the discovery could help people with d ##ys ##cal ##cu ##lia , who may struggle with numbers . [SEP] [CLS] another expert said effects on other brain functions would need checking . [SEP] [CLS] the findings are reported in the journal current biology . [SEP] [CLS] some studies have suggested that up to one in five people have trouble with math ##s , affecting not just their ability to complete problems but also to manage everyday activities such as telling the time and managing money . [SEP] [CLS] ne ##uro ##sc ##ient ##ists believe that activity within the par ##ie ##tal lobe plays a crucial role in this ability , or the lack of it . [SEP] [CLS] when magnetic fields were used in earlier research to disrupt electrical activity in this part of the brain , previously nu ##mer ##ate volunteers temporarily developed disc ##al ##cu ##lia , finding it much harder to solve math ##s problems . [SEP] [CLS] the latest research goes a step further , using a one mill ##iam ##p current to stimulate the par ##ie ##tal lobe of a small number of students . [SEP] [CLS] the current could not be felt , and had no me ##asurable effect on other brain functions . [SEP] [CLS] as it was turned on , the volunteers tried to learn a puzzle which involved sub ##stituting numbers for symbols . [SEP] [CLS] those given the current from right to left across the par ##ie ##tal lobe did significantly better when given , compared to those who were given no electrical stimulation . [SEP] [CLS] the direction of the current was important - those given stimulation running in the opposite direction , left to right , did markedly worse at these puzzles than those given no current , with their ability matching that of an average six ##- ##year ##- ##old . [SEP] [CLS] the effects were not short ##- ##li ##ved , either . [SEP] [CLS] when the volunteers whose performance improved was re ##- ##test ##ed six months later , the benefits appear to have persisted . [SEP] [CLS] there was no wider effect on general math ##s ability in either group , just on the ability to complete the puzzles learned as the current was applied . [SEP] [CLS] dr cohen ka ##dos ##h , who led the study , said : ` ##` we are not advising people to go around giving themselves electric shocks , but we are extremely excited by the potential of our findings and are now looking into the underlying brain changes . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we ' ##ve shown before that we can induce d ##ys ##cal ##cu ##lia , and now it seems we might be able to make someone better at math ##s , so we
[CLS] it is likely to include a scrap ##page scheme for older diesel cars in areas with high levels of dirty air . [SEP] [CLS] speed bumps could be removed in some cities to cut pollution from cars slowing down and speeding up . [SEP] [CLS] environmental lawyers client ##ear ##th said they would ` ##` thoroughly anal ##yse ' ##' the proposals . [SEP] [CLS] according to the royal college of physicians , air pollution across the uk is linked to around 40 ##, ##00 ##0 premature deaths every year . [SEP] [CLS] the uk has struggled to keep within eu limits on some poll ##uta ##nts , particularly nitrogen dioxide - ##lr ##b ##- no ##2 - ##rr ##b ##- , which is produced by diesel engines and is linked to a range of respiratory diseases including asthma . [SEP] [CLS] some 37 of the 43 regions of the uk are in breach of no ##2 limits . [SEP] [CLS] under earlier government plans , some parts of the uk would not have met eu no ##2 standards until 203 ##0 . [SEP] [CLS] the original deadline to achieve these limits was 2010 . [SEP] [CLS] exasperated by what they believed was government foot ##- ##dra ##gging on the question of cleaner air , client ##ear ##th mounted a legal challenge to force faster action . [SEP] [CLS] in april 2015 , the uk supreme court ruled the government had to take immediate steps on the issue . [SEP] [CLS] unhappy with the times ##cal ##es in the plan that was then produced , client ##ear ##th went to the high court last november for a judicial review . [SEP] [CLS] once again the court supported the lawyers , telling the government that its scheme was ` ##` wo ##ef ##ull ##y inadequate ' ##' and giving ministers until 24 april this year to produce a new draft . [SEP] [CLS] with a general election in the off ##ing , the government last week asked the judge for permission to delay the draft plan . [SEP] [CLS] but mr justice ga ##rn ##ham disagreed and ordered publication by 9 may . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` these steps are necessary in order to safeguard public health , ' ##' he said . [SEP] [CLS] earlier this week , the government said it would not appeal against the ruling and would publish . [SEP] [CLS] in their previous plans , ministers wanted to create ` ##` clean air zones ' ##' in five cities outside london with high levels of no ##2 . [SEP] [CLS] only the most poll ##uting vehicles would have to pay a charge to enter the zone under that scheme . [SEP] [CLS] the new draft plan is expected to create many more such zones . [SEP] [CLS] councils will be given the power to impose fines or restrictions on all poll ##uting vehicles in these areas . [SEP] [CLS] in the worst cities , so

[CLS] the competition which takes place on the clyde this weekend , between glasgow and edinburgh universities , was first staged 140 years ago .

[SEP] [CLS] preparing for the race means lots of early morning training sessions . [SEP] [CLS] one such dawn chorus greeted the glasgow university rower ##s as they arrived for their 06 ##: ##45 session on the river clyde by glasgow green . [SEP] [CLS] those taking part are students from a wide variety of courses but they are linked by a passion for rowing . [SEP] [CLS] the first scottish boat race took place on the river clyde in 1877 . [SEP] [CLS] both edinburgh and glasgow university rowing clubs were formed 10 years earlier than that , so it is a rivalry which is more than a decade older than that of football ' ##s old firm of celtic and rangers . [SEP] [CLS] in an extraordinary winning streak glasgow won every year between 2000 and 2012 but for the past four years edinburgh has triumph ##ed . [SEP] [CLS] glasgow 1st viii captain gavin shields says they have been working hard to regain their form . [SEP] [CLS] he says : ` ##` we ' ##ve had a really good few years of developing some guys coming straight from begin ##ner level . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it ' ##s definitely a work in progress . [SEP] [CLS] edinburgh have have some really good results but it just makes us work harder to try to beat them .

[SEP] [CLS] the terri ##ers ' seventh win in nine league matches keeps them fifth , but they are now just two points behind fourth ##- ##placed leeds , who they play at home on sunday . [SEP] [CLS] brighton , knocked out of the fa cup by non ##- ##lea ##gue lincoln five days earlier , were un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##istic ##ally poor in defence and conceded three goals in a league match for the first time in almost 12 months .

[SEP] [CLS] hem ##ed po ##unced on a poor back header from huddersfield ' ##s aaron mo ##oy to level , but that proved to be the only clear chance they created in the entire 90 minutes . [SEP] [CLS] wells ' excellent finish from just inside the box was his 100th goal in english football , and it was the former bradford forward ' ##s shot which goalkeeper david stock ##dale palm ##ed into the air for ka ##chu ##nga to head in huddersfield ' ##s third from close range . [SEP] [CLS] after dun ##k ' ##s dismissal , the fifth of his career , there was still time for australian midfielder mo ##oy to strike the upright from long range and stock ##dale to tip over a powerful attempt from substitute ka ##sey palmer .

[SEP] [CLS] the win extended preston ' ##s unbeaten run to seven games as they rose to ninth place in the championship , while norwich slipped from second place to fourth as they lost for just the third time this season .

[CLS] previously , trainee doctors had to wait up to four years to experience the consultation room . [SEP] [CLS] gp live was developed by aberdeen university and uses streaming software to enter the consultation room . [SEP] [CLS] researchers hope it will encourage more students to join general practice and help ease a recruitment crisis .

[SEP] [CLS] it was developed by dr john mc ##ke ##own , a senior clinical lecturer and gp at cult ##s medical group in aberdeen . [SEP] [CLS] he said : ` ##` the biggest appeal for students is that they are seeing consultation ##s that are almost live , and this adds a sense of im ##media ##cy that appeals to students who have grown up in an era where digit ##isation has made learning far more interactive . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we aim to make the sessions as engaging as possible by discussing the gp ' ##s approach while the consultation takes place - for example how they communicate , the direction that they take the consultation , and of course their recommended course of action . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] dr mc ##ke ##own said that one of the main benefits of the system was that students and lecturer ##s would be able to discuss consultation ##s that have taken place at a variety of practices , where the issues could be very different . [SEP] [CLS] he added : ` ##` this means that students get a real insight into the challenges facing gps who might operate in less affluent areas , or in remote rural locations . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the system also allows us to work through a number of different consultation ##s in succession , which very much mimic ##s a typical morning for a gp . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` this allows us to see the range of skills - inter ##personal , diagnostic and otherwise - that they bring to a normal working day .

[SEP] [CLS] mps voted to reject the bill by 352 votes to 58 . [SEP] [CLS] the bill came from an anti ##- ##ab ##ort ##ion citizens ' initiative that gathered some 450 ##, ##00 ##0 signatures . [SEP] [CLS] it was initially backed by the catholic church , but bishops then said they could not support one of the proposals , to jail women who had an abortion .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` abortion will certainly not be banned when the woman is the victim of rape or if her life or her health is in danger , ' ##' he insisted . [SEP] [CLS] since law and justice came to power last year , it has been criticised by the eu for taking control of state media appointments and for reforms to poland ' ##s constitutional court . [SEP] [CLS] abortion is already largely banned in poland . [SEP] [CLS] the only exceptions are a severe and ir ##re ##vers ##ible damage to the foe ##tus , a serious threat to the mother ' ##s health , or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or inc ##est . [SEP] [CLS] the stop abortion campaign group wanted the ban extended to cases of rape and inc ##est . [SEP] [CLS] the only exception would have been where the mother ' ##s life was in danger . [SEP] [CLS] doctors already risk punishment if they carry out an illegal termination .

[CLS] it is that time of the year again , when we take stock of the highs and low ##s of the last 12 months . [SEP] [CLS] from the perspective of a news reporter , there have been some stand ##- ##out moments . [SEP] [CLS] ins ##ec ##urity was a running concern in many parts of the continent in 2013 . [SEP] [CLS] the beginning of the year saw a major operation in mali led by french forces to recapture cities and towns that had been taken over by militant islamist ##s and tu ##are ##g rebels . [SEP] [CLS] to a large extent , the operation , which is still ongoing , has been a success . [SEP] [CLS] i could not help but see the irony watching french president francois holland ##e welcomed as a hero and li ##ber ##ator in mali in the same year the african union marked 50 years of its existence . [SEP] [CLS] some of the security concerns of this year will drag on into 2014 . [SEP] [CLS] the conflict in the central african republic - ##lr ##b ##- car - ##rr ##b ##- , which started with a rebellion to overthrow ex ##- ##fra ##nco ##is bo ##zi ##ze , is worse ##ning . [SEP] [CLS] 2013 will also be remembered as the year the leaders of south sudan handed their people the worst of holiday gifts . [SEP] [CLS] political disputes have taken on a military dimension . [SEP] [CLS] for a nation that is just two years old and had suffered decades of war before gaining independence , one would have thought the south sudanese would not see fighting each other as an option . [SEP] [CLS] elsewhere in the neighbourhood , the m2 ##3 rebels were defeated in the democratic republic of congo by the combined efforts of the army and united nations - ##lr ##b ##- un - ##rr ##b ##- troops . [SEP] [CLS] but there is still a long way to go before all the militia who operate in the area are subdued .

[SEP] [CLS] rule number two : nothing in this list was created specifically to go viral . [SEP] [CLS] as in , a committee of advertising executives did n ##' ##t sit around a room and decide how to spend money on making it a hit . [SEP] [CLS] of course , everyone wants their posts to be popular , but let ' ##s just say this list is intended to feature some of the more organic fun . [SEP] [CLS] one of the remarkable things about ru ##air ##i mc ##sor ##ley is how he managed to change a tiny sound ##bit ##e into a media career . [SEP] [CLS] asked by ut ##v reporter gareth wilkinson about the weather conditions in northern ireland , mc ##sor ##ley ' ##s charming accent led to him being dubbed the most irish man in the world . [SEP] [CLS] his ` ##` frost ##bit ' ##' sound ##bit ##e has led to countless tv appearances , events and , soon , a charity single . [SEP] [CLS] if you ' ##re not a fan of american football - and sometimes even if you are - the half ##- ##time show is the most interesting part of the sporting extra ##va ##gan ##za . [SEP] [CLS] and not since janet jackson ' ##s wardrobe ` ##` mal ##fu ##nction ' ##' has their been a more talked about moment than singer katy perry ' ##s performance .

[SEP] [CLS] g ##la ##x ##os ##mith ##k ##line and ve ##rily , formerly google , life sciences , are behind it . [SEP] [CLS] animal experiments have attached tiny silicon ##e cuffs , containing electrode ##s , around a nerve and then used a power supply to control the nerve ' ##s messages . [SEP] [CLS] one set of tests suggested the approach could help treat type ##- ##2 diabetes , in which the body ignores the hormone insulin . [SEP] [CLS] they focused on a cluster of chemical sensors near the main artery in the neck that check levels of sugar and the hormone insulin . [SEP] [CLS] the sensors send their findings back to the brain , via a nerve , so the organ can coordinate the body ' ##s response to sugar in the blood ##stream . [SEP] [CLS] gs ##k vice ##- ##pres ##ide ##nt of bio ##ele ##ct ##ron ##ics kris fa ##mm told the bbc news website : ` ##` the neural signatures in the nerve increase in type 2 ##- ##dia ##bet ##es . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` by blocking those neural signals in dia ##bet ##ic rats , you see the sensitivity of the body to insulin is restored . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] and early work suggested it could work in other diseases too . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it is n ##' ##t just a one ##- ##trick ##- ##pon ##y , it is something that if we get it right could have a new class of the ##ra ##pies on our hands , ' ##' mr fa ##mm said . [SEP] [CLS] but he said the field was only ` ##` scratching the surface ' ##' when it came to understanding which nerve signals have what effect in the body . [SEP] [CLS] both the volume and rhythm of the nerve signals could be having an effect rather than it being a simple case of turning the nerve on or off . [SEP] [CLS] and even if the approach works theoretically , a huge amount of effort will be needed to make the technology practical . [SEP] [CLS] the kits to hack the nerves will need to be mini ##at ##uri ##sed , custom ##isa ##ble to different patients ' nerves , durable enough to survive in the body long ##- ##ter ##m and have sufficient battery power . [SEP] [CLS] dr fa ##mm added : ` ##` in 10 to 20 years i think there will be a set of these mini ##at ##uri ##sed precision the ##ra ##pies that will be available for you and me when we go to a doctor .

[SEP] [CLS] when photography was invented in the 1840s we could finally see how people really lived , as opposed to how a few of them , privileged , posed for the painted version of their lives .

[SEP] [CLS] the cp ##s said cases were kept under ` ##` constant review ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] a study of the data suggested the principal reason for the fall in the proportion of cases resulting in conviction was because of the rise in the number that were dropped by the cp ##s after charges had been brought .

[SEP] [CLS] the target for treating people diagnosed with cancer within 62 days fell from 85 ##. ##8 % during the previous quarter to 84 ##. ##4 % in the first three months of 2014 . [SEP] [CLS] mike ho ##b ##day , director of policy and research at macmillan cancer support , said the number of trusts missing this target had doubled over the last year .

[CLS] in his regular bbc sport column , football pun ##dit robbie savage looks at why liverpool look a long way off repeating last season ' ##s title challenge , how they should line up against chelsea and the physical and mental battle steven ge ##rrard faces to secure a long ##- ##ter ##m future with the reds . [SEP] [CLS] it is only six months since steven ge ##rrard ' ##s slip helped the blues clinch a famous win on mer ##sey ##side that der ##ailed liverpool ' ##s title bid . [SEP] [CLS] back then , at the end of april , the title was in the reds ' grasp . [SEP] [CLS] this weekend , i think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge . [SEP] [CLS] they are miles away from the level required for that , and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four . [SEP] [CLS] if they manage it , then securing back ##- ##to ##- ##back seasons in the champions league should be seen as success for liverpool boss brendan rodgers . [SEP] [CLS] but not all their fans see it that way . [SEP] [CLS] i had some unhappy reds supporters calling me up on 60 ##6 on bbc radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick . [SEP] [CLS] part of liverpool ' ##s problem is that they over ##achi ##eve ##d massive ##ly last season , which has raised expectations un ##real ##istic ##ally . [SEP] [CLS] that is not rodgers ' fault . [SEP] [CLS] where he can be questioned is in the transfer market , especially up front . [SEP] [CLS] between them luis suarez and daniel stu ##rri ##dge scored 52 of liverpool ' ##s 101 premier league goals last season . [SEP] [CLS] with suarez sold and stu ##rri ##dge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury , rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line ##- ##up . [SEP] [CLS] but he has had money to spend and i do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system . [SEP] [CLS] looking at rodgers ' options up front for saturday , mario bal ##ote ##lli , rick ##ie lambert and fabio bo ##rini are his three available front men , and the bottom line is that they are not good enough . [SEP] [CLS] it is not just that they do not look like scoring . [SEP] [CLS] there is a big difference in their work ##- ##rate compared to what suarez and stu ##rri ##dge gave the team . [SEP] [CLS] that means liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season , or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes .

[CLS] sir kei ##r star ##mer said there was a ` ##` very strong case ' ##' for the crown prosecution service to make the final decision on whether to prose ##cute cases . [SEP] [CLS] currently , police forces in england and wales decide whether to pass a case on to the cp ##s after investigating a death . [SEP] [CLS] the cp ##s said cases should be referred to a prosecutor as early as possible . [SEP] [CLS] department of transport figures show 113 cyclists were killed in the uk last year . [SEP] [CLS] last year a freedom of information request by bbc ' ##s news ##beat found that between 2007 and 2014 there were 276 recorded incidents where a cyclist was killed in an accident involving a motor vehicle . [SEP] [CLS] of these , 148 - 54 % - resulted in the driver of the vehicle being charged with an offence . [SEP] [CLS] of those found guilty , fewer than half went to prison . [SEP] [CLS] sir kei ##r , now a labour mp , told the bbc ' ##s victoria derbyshire programme that if a death was involved and it was serious enough to have had a criminal investigation ` ##` then it really ought to go off to the cp ##s for the final decision ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] in scotland , if evidence suggests the driver is to blame for a collision that leads to a cyclist ' ##s death , a report is to be submitted to the pro ##cu ##rator fiscal . [SEP] [CLS] but data compiled from a 2014 freedom of information request to police scotland suggests this happened in only a small number of cases . [SEP] [CLS] cycling campaign ##ers are calling for a change in liability - who is considered responsible for a collision - in civil cases . [SEP] [CLS] at the moment there is no pre ##sum ##ption on either side . [SEP] [CLS] last year , my dad mick was killed as he cycle ##d through central london . [SEP] [CLS] after three weeks in a coma , he died . [SEP] [CLS] at the in ##quest the driver said the first she realised was when she heard a noise , like something falling from the sky . [SEP] [CLS] the coroner returned a verdict of accidental death . [SEP] [CLS] we had questions about how the police were investigating from very early on .

[CLS] culture secretary maria miller said ` ##` dec ##rim ##inal ##isation of the licence fee should be on the table ' ##' during the bbc ' ##s charter review before 2017 . [SEP] [CLS] the bbc said changing the law could lead to more people failing to pay . [SEP] [CLS] in 2012 about 155 ##, ##00 ##0 were convicted and fined for not paying the # 145 ##. ##50 fee . [SEP] [CLS] in total 180 ##, ##00 ##0 people were prosecuted for not paying their licence - which is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device - accounting for more than one in 10 criminal prosecution ##s that year . [SEP] [CLS] in october 2013 huffington post reported that in response to a freedom of information request the ministry of justice had revealed that 107 people were jailed between january 2011 and march 2013 for failing to pay fines related to not having a tv licence . [SEP] [CLS] justice secretary chris gray ##ling has now told the daily telegraph ` ##` serious work ' ##' would be done on the proposal to make non ##- ##pa ##yme ##nt a civil offence and that it could ease the pressure on criminal courts . [SEP] [CLS] he said : ` ##` the culture secretary and i both agree that this is a really interesting idea - particularly given the pressure on our courts system . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` our departments will be doing some serious work on the proposal . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] ms miller said : ` ##` this is an interesting idea but timing is crucial and dec ##rim ##inal ##isation of the licence fee should be on the table during charter review , not separate to the process . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the bbc ' ##s current royal charter , which ex ##pire ##s in 2016 , sets out how it should be funded , what it does and how it is managed . [SEP] [CLS] a spokesman for the culture secretary added : ` ##` maria will put dec ##rim ##inal ##isation of the licence fee on the table during charter review discussions , but to do it before makes no sense . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` she has made clear that the bbc needs to get its house in order , particularly when it comes to governance and transparency , having dec ##rim ##inal ##isation on the table during the negotiations will focus the bbc ' ##s minds . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] but conservative mp andrew bridge ##n is seeking to introduce the change through an amendment to the government ' ##s der ##eg ##ulation bill . [SEP] [CLS] it would make non ##- ##pa ##yme ##nt of the licence fee a civil matter , with a fine for offenders set by the government .

[CLS] the 51 ##- ##year ##- ##old london mayor has spent more than a decade combining the gr ##avi ##tas of his various roles with an un ##ke ##mpt , humorous persona rarely seen in modern public life . [SEP] [CLS] prime minister david cameron expressed his delight when mr johnson announced his decision to run for parliament again in 2015 , saying : ` ##` i want my star players on the pitch . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] but now the mp for u ##x ##bridge and south ru ##is ##lip has said he will campaign against the pm in the eu referendum , relations between the two may become more tense . [SEP] [CLS] the big question is whether the blond ##- ##hair ##ed old eton ##ian wants simply to play for the team or to captain it . [SEP] [CLS] he has arguably the highest profile of any conservative except mr cameron and is thought by many to harbour an ambition to be prime minister . [SEP] [CLS] when he beat labour ' ##s ken livingstone to become london mayor in 2008 it was the tori ##es ' first high ##- ##pro ##fi ##le election success since before tony blair ' ##s triumphant entry into downing street in 1997 . [SEP] [CLS] he defeated mr livingstone again in 2012 , giving him even more of a winner ' ##s aura . [SEP] [CLS] the hoop ##la surrounding mr johnson broke out again when he ended months of speculation by confirming he would try to return to the commons as mp for u ##x ##bridge and south ru ##is ##lip . [SEP] [CLS] he swept into the safe conservative london seat in the 2015 general election , taking a spot at the cabinet table as minister without portfolio . [SEP] [CLS] given the opportunity to enter downing street on a fort ##night ##ly basis , cycle helmet in hand , was seen as recognition for his unique rap ##port with voters . [SEP] [CLS] but crucial ##ly he is not bound by collective cabinet responsibility , giving him the freedom to rebel against controversial decisions without having to resign . [SEP] [CLS] although lauded by conservative activists for his witty speeches , euros ##ce ##ptic ##ism and lack of pr polish , mr johnson ' ##s political life has not been b ##lem ##ish ##- ##free . [SEP] [CLS] in 2004 he had to make a visit to liverpool to ap ##olo ##gis ##e for an article in the spectator magazine , which he then edited .

[SEP] [CLS] the three ##- ##mont ##h protest was sparked by a local dispute between catholic and protestant residents in ar ##do ##yne , north belfast . [SEP] [CLS] the protestants claimed that catholics were attacking their homes and said the school protest was their way of highlighting their concerns . [SEP] [CLS] however , stones , bottles , fireworks and even a blast bomb were used during weeks of unrest .

[CLS] the dinosaurs were able to make the journey when a spell of warming allowed passage over frozen land bridges between the continents . [SEP] [CLS] two fossil discoveries in australia shed new light on this theory . [SEP] [CLS] both specimens are sa ##uro ##pods - a group of large , herb ##ivo ##rous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads . [SEP] [CLS] further classified as titan ##osa ##urs , they are among the largest dinosaurs ever to walk the earth . [SEP] [CLS] lead researcher dr stephen por ##op ##ot , of the australian age of dinosaurs museum , said the specimens add to our knowledge of the area 95 to 98 million years ago . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we get a much better idea of the overall fauna , ' ##' he said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` and as a result we can start pie ##cing together how climate affected these dinosaurs , how the positions of the continent affected those dinosaurs and how they evolved through time as well . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] one of the dinosaurs was found near the town of win ##ton in central west queensland . [SEP] [CLS] it has been named savanna ##saurus elliott ##orum after members of the elliott family , who found the fossil in a pile of bones while rounding up sheep at their property . [SEP] [CLS] the skeleton has been piece ##d together from 17 pal ##lets of bones en ##cased in rock - a process that took 10 years . [SEP] [CLS] the researchers also uncovered head bones from another sa ##uro ##pod species dia ##man ##tina ##saurus matilda ##e . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` this new dia ##man ##tina ##saurus specimen has helped to fill several gaps in our knowledge of this dinosaur ' ##s skeletal anatomy , ' ##' said dr por ##opa ##t . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the brain ##case in particular has allowed us to ref ##ine dia ##man ##tina ##saurus ' position on the sa ##uro ##pod family tree . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the two specimens have helped to show that titan ##osa ##urs were living worldwide by 100 million years ago . [SEP] [CLS] this became possible because of the arrangement of the continents and changes in the global climate . [SEP] [CLS] prof paul up ##church , of university college , london , said australia and south america were connected to antarctica throughout much of the cretaceous . [SEP] [CLS] when savanna ##saurus was alive , 95 million years ago , global average temperatures were warmer than they are now , but it was quite cool at the poles . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we suspect that the ancestor of savanna ##saurus was from south america , but that it could not and did not enter australia until approximately 105 million years ago , ' ##' he said .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it was a crisis , ' ##' said the scotland manager , earnest ##ly . [SEP] [CLS] crisis was a strong word to use , but it was st ##rac ##han ' ##s word and it was a revealing one . [SEP] [CLS] it spoke not just to the pre ##dic ##ament his team were in against a nation ranked 176 ##th in the world but also to scotland ' ##s previous opening days in major championship qualification . [SEP] [CLS] the 0 ##- ##0 draw against lithuania that got the euro 2000 campaign off to a grim start . [SEP] [CLS] the 2 ##- ##2 draw against the far ##oes in the first round of matches for euro 2004 . [SEP] [CLS] the 0 ##- ##0 draw with slovenia in week one of the qualifiers for world cup 2006 . [SEP] [CLS] the loss to macedonia on the first day of the campaign to make the world cup in 2010 . [SEP] [CLS] the draw with lithuania that put scotland on the back foot straight away in the euro 2012 qualifiers . [SEP] [CLS] the draw with serbia that did the same for world cup 2014 . [SEP] [CLS] scotland failed to qualify for all those tournaments , as if anybody needs reminding . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` everybody was concerned , ' ##' said st ##rac ##han , about half ##- ##time in malta . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` but we had a bunch of lads who could deal with the stress . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] scotland had enjoyed 72 ##. ##5 % possession in that opening half and their dominance of the ball was n ##' ##t reflected in a dominance on the score ##board . [SEP] [CLS] this is not unusual when teams play malta , but it ' ##s still un ##sett ##ling at the time . [SEP] [CLS] lots of possession does n ##' ##t always mean lots of goals . [SEP] [CLS] malta can be slap ##stick but , on their very best days , they can also be stuff ##y . [SEP] [CLS] st ##rac ##han would have known that . [SEP] [CLS] maybe that ' ##s where the mention of a ` ##` crisis ' ##' came from , a real ##isation that while the min ##now ##s do n ##' ##t win matches , they do have the capacity , from time to time , to fr ##ust ##rate . [SEP] [CLS] in the qualifiers for euro 2016 , italy had 71 % possession - ##lr ##b ##- and a one ##- ##man advantage for 46 minutes - ##rr ##b ##- against malta and yet only scored once against them . [SEP] [CLS] in the return match , they had 70 % possession and
[CLS] in 2015 , voter turnout among 18 - to 24 ##- ##year ##- ##old ##s was estimated to be 43 % , compared with a 66 ##. ##1 % turnout overall . [SEP] [CLS] this year , you ##go ##v puts the youth turnout at 58 % . [SEP] [CLS] polling traditionally shows that a majority of young people vote labour . [SEP] [CLS] this year , the proportion has jumped to 63 % for 18 ##- ##29 ##- ##year ##- ##old ##s , according to you ##go ##v . [SEP] [CLS] so how did this change happen ? [SEP] [CLS] sam jeff ##ers , co ##- ##fo ##under of who targets me , which monitored the use of social media ad ##vert ##s by the political parties during the general election , said it seemed clear that labour defeated the conservatives in the social media battle . [SEP] [CLS] labour ' ##s ad ##vert ##s had consistently been shared more widely by social media users , he said . [SEP] [CLS] part of this appears to be down to the difference in tone of the ad ##vert ##s . [SEP] [CLS] while the conservatives had almost entirely focused their ad ##vert ##s on the strength of prime minister theresa may and the weakness of labour leader jeremy co ##rb ##yn , labour ' ##s social media ad ##vert ##s had been more positive , seeking to emphasis ##e that the party was building a social movement , he said . [SEP] [CLS] and this had been combined with the repeated use of ad ##vert ##s with practical messages designed to increase youth voter turnout by giving instructions on how to register to vote and where to find local polling stations . [SEP] [CLS] ad ##vert ##s also appeared to have been released on specific days on the basis that their message was likely to cut through for only a limited amount of time , mr jeff ##ers said . [SEP] [CLS] for example , labour had invested heavily on ad ##vert ##s attacking the tori ##es ' so ##- ##cal ##led ` ##` dementia tax ' ##' on social care costs , days before the 8 june election . [SEP] [CLS] the aim of this appeared to be to suppress the older , potentially conservative , vote or get them to switch to labour at the last minute , mr jeff ##ers said . [SEP] [CLS] labour also focused its attention on more of the uk , targeting 46 ##4 constituencies in the final two days of the election campaign . [SEP] [CLS] was it facebook wo ##t swung it ? [SEP] [CLS] while the labour party paid for targeted ad ##vert ##s on social media , momentum - the group that was set up to support mr co ##rb ##yn ' ##s leadership bid and now campaigns for labour - had a different social media strategy . [SEP] [CLS] rather than pay for advertising , it instead

[SEP] [CLS] with 1 ##. ##2 million british nationals in australia , and 250 ##, ##00 ##0 in new zealand , both the stay and leave camps are in full campaign mode half a world away from the uk . [SEP] [CLS] southern hemisphere votes have the potential to swing the knife ##- ##edge referendum . [SEP] [CLS] posters supporting both sides have sp ##routed in areas popular with uk residents . [SEP] [CLS] in some locations , such as perth , up to 15 % of the population was born in england . [SEP] [CLS] the referendum vote is optional . [SEP] [CLS] as a result there has been a strong campaign just urging voters to post their ballot slips back from australia .

[CLS] paul chambers , 27 , from doncaster , who now lives in northern ireland , was convicted in may 2011 of sending a ` ##` menacing electronic communication ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] he claimed it was a joke and wants his conviction and sentence qu ##ash ##ed . [SEP] [CLS] comedian stephen fry , who was at the high court hearing , said it was ` ##` very important ' ##' for freedom of speech . [SEP] [CLS] the judgement was reserved until a later date . [SEP] [CLS] mr chambers said he had sent the t ##wee ##t , which contained swear words , to his 600 followers in a moment of frustration after robin hood airport in south yorkshire was closed by snow in january 2010 . [SEP] [CLS] he said he had never thought anyone would take his ` ##` silly joke ' ##' seriously . [SEP] [CLS] the message chambers t ##wee ##ted stated : ` ##` crap ! [SEP] [CLS] robin hood airport is closed . [SEP] [CLS] you ' ##ve got a week and a bit to get your shit together , otherwise i ' ##m blowing the airport sky high ! ##! ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] paul chambers ' qc told the high court that you ca n ##' ##t define exactly a ` ##` menacing threat ' ##' - but ` ##` you know it when you see it . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] and this is the question at the heart of the appeal : did those who read the t ##wee ##t regard it as a joke or a bomb threat ? [SEP] [CLS] his lawyers argue the context of the words are very important and that the judges should take into account where and how they appeared on his twitter timeline . [SEP] [CLS] whether the judges will draw a distinction between offensive messages on social networks and those sent by other means remains to be seen . [SEP] [CLS] the case to uphold the conviction is simple : it does n ##' ##t matter if mr chambers ' friends cho ##rt ##led as they read his t ##wee ##t as a joke . [SEP] [CLS] it became a crime because anyone at all , of reasonable state of mind , could regard it as a genuine threat . [SEP] [CLS] and that ' ##s the argument he has to defeat . [SEP] [CLS] he was found guilty by doncaster magistrates in may 2010 , fined ? ##? [SEP] [CLS] 385 and ordered to pay ? ##? [SEP] [CLS] an appeal was dismissed in november 2010 with a crown court judge stating that the electronic communication was ` ##` clearly menacing ' ##' and that airport staff were sufficiently concerned to report it .

[CLS] the review into 22 abuse cases in northern ireland criticised the authorities for not doing enough .

[SEP] [CLS] the police service of northern ireland - ##lr ##b ##- ps ##ni - ##rr ##b ##- said it has recently made policy changes aimed at keeping children safe . [SEP] [CLS] in september 2013 , the ps ##ni said it had begun a major investigation into the sexual exploitation of children and young people who had gone missing from care in northern ireland . [SEP] [CLS] officers said they had identified 22 people , aged between 13 and 18 , who may have been sexually exploited . [SEP] [CLS] the ps ##ni investigation was known was operation owl . [SEP] [CLS] thursday ' ##s report , examining the ps ##ni response , has been published by the safeguard ##ing board for northern ireland . [SEP] [CLS] it said ps ##ni officers were effective in locating the teenagers and returning them to the care system . [SEP] [CLS] however , it found that they failed to properly examine the extent of the child sexual exploitation taking place and their attempts to find and stop the abuse ##rs was - in the words of the review - ` ##` limited and inconsistent ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] while there is praise for the help offered by some staff from residential care homes , storm ##ont ' ##s health minister simon hamilton said that the report shows not enough support was given to protect the teenagers from harm or the risk of harm . [SEP] [CLS] he said the review had identified ` ##` a significant gap ' ##' in knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual exploitation . [SEP] [CLS] the head of the ps ##ni ' ##s public protection branch , det ch su ##pt george clarke said that following operation owl , the ps ##ni has ` ##` implemented a number of changes in our approach to handling this issue to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep children and young people safe ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` indeed , in april of this year , the ps ##ni formed the public protection branch which is now responsible for policy and practice in relation to a number of areas including child sexual exploitation . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the new structures enable us to work closely with our partner agencies in a much more co ##hesive way than before to ensure better protection and safeguard ##ing for children and young people .

[SEP] [CLS] with 15 laps to go , it appeared as if hamilton was going to miss out , as he led the race but appeared a sitting duck with ro ##sberg on fresh ##er tyres and closing in behind after stopping under a virtual safety car period while hamilton stayed out . [SEP] [CLS] but then a heavy crash for red bull ' ##s dani ##il kv ##yat when the russian lost control at turn 19 gave hamilton a life ##line when the actual safety car was deployed . [SEP] [CLS] he stopped for fresh tyres and rejoined in second place , right behind ro ##sberg , and the two were set up for an all ##- ##out battle for victory in the closing 10 laps . [SEP] [CLS] now hamilton had the advantage , on tyres eight laps fresh ##er , and on lap 48 of 56 ro ##sberg lost traction out of the turn 12 hair ##pin at the end of the long back straight , his car flicked from side to side and he ran wide off the track as hamilton swept into the lead .

[SEP] [CLS] united and chelsea are now the only premier league sides with a 100 % record from three games , with manchester city - who have two wins from two games - playing west ham on sunday .

[CLS] several thousand people who lived at the camp were moved to new homes around france last week . [SEP] [CLS] however , around 1 ##, ##500 children still remained living at the camp in temporary shelters . [SEP] [CLS] a week after the demolition first begun , these children have now been taken to special centres around france where they can be properly processed . [SEP] [CLS] but why were these people being made to move ? [SEP] [CLS] and why were they in calais in the first place ? [SEP] [CLS] the jungle is situated at a place called calais , which is on the north coast of france , right near to the uk . [SEP] [CLS] many thousands of people travelled across europe and arrived at calais in order to try to cross the english channel to reach the uk , where they believed they could live a better life . [SEP] [CLS] this is because calais is one of the main ports for travelling from france to england , with lots of vehicles , ships and trains that travel to england from here . [SEP] [CLS] however , the refugees were being stopped at calais before they could complete the last part of their journey , as they are not allowed to simply enter the uk without going through an official process . [SEP] [CLS] this means they had to set up temporary homes at calais . [SEP] [CLS] as a result , the jungle had become home to thousands of people , desperate to finish their journey and make a new start in the uk . [SEP] [CLS] earlier this year , authorities in france announced plans to close the camp and an area of it was cleared . [SEP] [CLS] however , the final demolition of the jungle shelters has now been completed . [SEP] [CLS] the authorities did this because they did not believe it was a situation people should be living in , and they needed to find a better solution . [SEP] [CLS] people had been living in very poor and dirty conditions . [SEP] [CLS] furthermore , there were reports of violence and trouble in the camp , meaning it was n ##' ##t always a safe place for people to live . [SEP] [CLS] local people in calais had also been campaigning for the jungle to close down , as they did not want it in their area . [SEP] [CLS] many of those living in the jungle had been making desperate attempts to reach the uk quicker , by jumping onto lo ##rries that are travelling to england . [SEP] [CLS] this is extremely dangerous and is also illegal . [SEP] [CLS] the thousands of people who lived in the camp have been made to leave their temporary homes behind . [SEP] [CLS] thousands of migrants have been taken to official centres all over france , where the authorities say the living conditions will be better .
[CLS] an investigation into pembroke ##shire council ' ##s dealings with michael smith said it was ` ##` only luck ' ##' that stopped his application . [SEP] [CLS] the 2015 review was confidential , but a copy of the report has been exclusively obtained by the western telegraph . [SEP] [CLS] it revealed a head of service initially failed to provide information of child protection concerns about smith . [SEP] [CLS] pembroke ##shire council said ` ##` it is unfortunate that a member of the authority has seen fit to disclose the report , contrary to advice ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] smith , from have ##rford ##west , was employed as a youth worker for the council between may 2001 and january 2012 . [SEP] [CLS] during that time he was the subject of three disciplinary hearings . [SEP] [CLS] allegations against him included allowing a child to sit on his lap and drive his land rover , allowing a child to sit in his land rover without wearing a seat ##belt , and a young person , who had been reported missing by their foster care ##r , had shown up at his home . [SEP] [CLS] the report , which was compiled by an independent social worker , said smith ` ##` displayed many groom ##ing behaviour ##s during the years he was employed by pembroke ##shire council but there were no direct allegations of abuse during this time ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] smith was dismissed for gross misconduct and in september 2013 a police investigation began after he was accused of sexually abu ##sing a boy . [SEP] [CLS] he was jailed for six years in july 2014 after admitting sexually assault ##ing a child under the age of 13 , inc ##iting the child to engage in sexual activity and taking ind ##ece ##nt photographs of the child . [SEP] [CLS] he also admitted possessing 1 ##, ##13 ##6 ind ##ece ##nt images of children . [SEP] [CLS] the report said in 2010 smith had applied to pembroke ##shire council to become a res ##pit ##e foster care ##r . [SEP] [CLS] the foster ##ing team wrote to the head of youth service for his views on smith ' ##s application . [SEP] [CLS] the report said the head of service had ` ##` replied in very positive terms ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] a formal reference form which the head of service was sent asked him to ` ##` highlight any concerns ' ##' regarding smith ' ##s employment , including any disciplinary proceedings and the outcomes . [SEP] [CLS] the head of service left the section blank . [SEP] [CLS] it was not until the papers were distributed to the foster panel that one of the members recalled smith had been investigated previously for inappropriate behaviour with children and had been disciplined . [SEP] [CLS] the panel concluded smith was not suitable for approval to be a foster care ##r .
[CLS] the communist party and military ##- ##run newspapers , such as the people ' ##s daily and the liberation army daily , are mostly carrying xi ##nh ##ua news agency ' ##s round ##- ##up on the first day of the trial tucked away on the inside pages and make no mention of the case on their front pages . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the accused , bo xi ##lai , gave a statement on the bribery charges and denied the charges ... the defendants and their counsel fully expressed their views . [SEP] [CLS] the defendant bo xi ##lai was emotionally stable and his physical condition was normal during the hearing . [SEP] [CLS] the courtroom was orderly , ' ##' says the ter ##se xi ##nh ##ua report without mentioning mr bo ' ##s defiant statements . [SEP] [CLS] official online media websites , however , attacked mr bo ' ##s personal character and his rejection of bribery charges after the first day of the trial closed .

' ##' [SEP] [CLS] says a commentary on the state ##- ##run china central television website . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` obviously , the legitimate rights of the defendant were fully guaranteed , and fairness , imp ##art ##ial ##ity and transparency were a major feature of the trial . [SEP] [CLS] however , bo ' ##s attitude towards the facts was to display cunning ##ness and to deny them by every means possible , ' ##' said one commentary in communist party ##- ##af ##fi ##lia ##ted website gu ##ang ##ming net . [SEP] [CLS] the mainland media are carrying fewer updates today from the jin ##an court ' ##s official micro ##bl ##og , except video testimony from mr bo ' ##s estranged wife gu kai ##lai about alleged payments received by the bo family from ty ##co ##on xu ming .

[SEP] [CLS] labour leader jeremy co ##rb ##yn has called for mr osborne ' ##s resignation and conservative mps have spoken out against the leadership with mr duncan smith ' ##s former ministerial team divided in their responses to his resignation . [SEP] [CLS] treasury minister david ga ##uke is answering an urgent commons question from labour ' ##s shadow chancellor john mcdonnell on changes to the budget - mr mcdonnell had called for the chancellor himself but this appears to have been ignored .

[SEP] [CLS] former tory leader lord howard urged mps to ` ##` listen to what the prime minister has to say ' ##' and to ` ##` calm down ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] mr duncan smith set out the reasons for his surprise resignation in an interview with the bbc ' ##s andrew mar ##r , in which he said the way mr osborne had cut benefits in his budget at the same time as cutting taxes for the better off was ` ##` deeply unfair ' ##' and that he had become ` ##` semi detached ' ##' from government .

[CLS] if this volume is hard to visual ##ise , imagine the earth ' ##s entire land surface covered in a layer some 180 ##m deep . [SEP] [CLS] the new calculation comes from a canadian ##- ##led team and is published in the journal nature geo ##sc ##ience . [SEP] [CLS] significantly , little of this water - just 6 % - is the kind of bank ##able resource that is most useful to people . [SEP] [CLS] that small fraction is referred to as ` ##` modern ' ##' groundwater : it is extract ##able because it is near the surface , and can be used to supplement above ##- ##ground resources in rivers and lakes . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it ' ##s the groundwater that is the most quickly renewed - on the scale of human lifetime ##s , ' ##' explained study leader tom glee ##son from the university of victoria . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` and yet this modern groundwater is also the most sensitive to climate change and to human contamination . [SEP] [CLS] so , it ' ##s a vital resource that we need to manage better . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] to quan ##tify just how much water is stored in the top 2 ##km of the earth ' ##s surface , dr glee ##son ' ##s team had to combine large data sets with an element of modelling . [SEP] [CLS] they included information on the per ##me ##ability of rocks and soil , on their por ##osity , and all that is known about water table gradient ##s , which tell you about inputs from precipitation . [SEP] [CLS] key to determining the age of all this stored water is a collection of thousands of tri ##tium measurements . [SEP] [CLS] tri ##tium is a radioactive form of hydrogen that spiked in the atmosphere 50 years ago as a result of the ##rm ##on ##uc ##lea ##r bomb tests . [SEP] [CLS] it can therefore be used as a trace ##r for all the rain that has made its way underground ever since . [SEP] [CLS] the map above shows the distribution of this modern groundwater around the globe . [SEP] [CLS] dark blue shows where it is very quickly renewed . [SEP] [CLS] light blue shows the older groundwater , which is mostly st ##ag ##nant and non ##- ##ren ##ew ##able . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` old water is highly variable , ' ##' dr glee ##son told bbc news . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` some places it is quite deep , in some places not . [SEP] [CLS] in many places , it can be poor quality . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it can be more saline even than ocean water and it can have lots of dissolved metals and other chemicals that would need to be treated before it could be used for drinking or agriculture .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we now have a deeper understanding of how we can achieve the best exchange for business , where the opportunities exist for scottish organisations and how we can best pursue these .

[CLS] however , since 1987 racial and political tensions have been a steady source of instability and international isolation . [SEP] [CLS] in 1987 a coup by indigenous fiji ##ans over ##th ##rew the elected , indian ##- ##dom ##inated coalition . [SEP] [CLS] this triggered a series of adverse events , including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution en ##sh ##rini ##ng indigenous fiji ##an political supremacy . [SEP] [CLS] a further coup in 2000 , led by businessman george sp ##ei ##ght , saw the country ' ##s first ethnic indian prime minister , his cabinet and several mps held hostage for several weeks . [SEP] [CLS] these events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and fiji ' ##s international reputation . [SEP] [CLS] ran ##co ##ur over the 2000 coup persisted , with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it . [SEP] [CLS] the continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a blood ##less military takeover in 2006 - fiji ' ##s fourth coup in 20 years . [SEP] [CLS] in september 2009 , fiji was suspended from the commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy . [SEP] [CLS] it was only the second full suspension in the organisation ' ##s history . [SEP] [CLS] in 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014 , prompting fiji ' ##s powerful neighbours australia and new zealand to restore full diplomatic ties . [SEP] [CLS] following the elections the commonwealth re ##- ##ins ##tated fiji as a member . [SEP] [CLS] fiji ' ##s population , which resides mostly on the two main islands of vi ##ti lev ##u and van ##ua lev ##u , is divided between indigenous fiji ##ans and indo ##- ##fi ##jian ##s , the descend ##ents of ind ##ent ##ured labourers brought from india . [SEP] [CLS] the two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid ##- ##200 ##0s , by which time coup ##s and agitation had prompted thousands of indo ##- ##fi ##jian ##s to flee . [SEP] [CLS] indigenous fiji ##ans now make up small overall majority . [SEP] [CLS] mixing between the two groups is minimal , and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society . [SEP] [CLS] there are also very small non ##- ##ind ##o ##- ##fi ##jian , non ##- ##fi ##jian minority communities , such as chinese and rot ##uman ##s . [SEP] [CLS] although the former british colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange , its economy is diverse . [SEP] [CLS] gold , silver and limestone are mined , and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing .

[SEP] [CLS] he did that by agreeing to becoming a top ##- ##se ##cre ##t contact between sworn enemies - the ira and the british government .

[SEP] [CLS] if thunder ##storm ##s are forecast , post ##pone or cancel outdoor activities - especially golf and rod fishing . [SEP] [CLS] if a storm is approaching , take cover inside or in a car with the windows wound up - sheds , isolated trees and convertible ##s do not afford sufficient protection .

[SEP] [CLS] it is also best to put off baths , showers and dish washing , in case lightning strikes the house and sends a jolt of electricity through the metal plumbing .

[CLS] some two dozen be ##hem ##oth ##s were identified , all with masses in excess of a hundred times that of the sun . [SEP] [CLS] four were known previously , including the remarkable col ##oss ##us catalogue ##d as r ##13 ##6 ##a1 , which is 250 times as massive as our home star . [SEP] [CLS] but the new survey finds many more of the super ##- ##ob ##ject ##s in a tight patch of sky within the large mage ##llan ##ic cloud . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` in just a tiny bit of this satellite galaxy , we see perhaps a couple of dozen stars with more than a 100 solar masses , of which nine are in a tight core just a few light ##- ##year ##s across , ' ##' explained prof paul crow ##ther from sheffield university , uk . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` but that two dozen number - that ' ##s probably more than are in the entire milky way galaxy for this type of star , ' ##' he told bbc news . [SEP] [CLS] the observations are to be published shortly in the monthly notices of the royal astronomical society . [SEP] [CLS] they build on earlier work reported in 2010 that first described r ##13 ##6 ##a1 - the most massive and most luminous star identified to date . [SEP] [CLS] that study used data gathered principally by a ground ##- ##base ##d telescope in chile . [SEP] [CLS] this follow ##- ##up research employed the pin ##- ##sha ##rp resolution and ultraviolet sensitivity of the orbiting hub ##ble telescope to tease out yet more detail . [SEP] [CLS] in 2010 , astronomers saw four monster stars including r ##13 ##6 ##a1 in the central core . [SEP] [CLS] thanks to hub ##ble , they detect a further five . [SEP] [CLS] the stars are not only extremely massive , but they are also extremely bright . [SEP] [CLS] together , these nine stars outs ##hine our sun by a factor of 30 million , said prof crow ##ther . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` because they are so massive , they are all close to their so ##- ##cal ##led ed ##dington limit , which is the maximum lu ##min ##osity a star can have before it rip ##s itself apart ; and so they ' ##ve got really powerful out ##flow ##s . [SEP] [CLS] they are shed ##ding mass at a fair rate of knots , ' ##' the astronomer added - up to an earth mass of gas ##eous material per month . [SEP] [CLS] the question is why this tight corner of space , located in the tara ##nt ##ula nebula of the l ##mc , harbour ##s so many giants . [SEP] [CLS] prof crow ##ther thinks it is because the gas and dust in the region has become compressed as the large mage ##llan ##ic cloud has skirt ##ed the edge of
[CLS] motorcycles used as taxis and known as bo ##da bo ##das are time ##- ##sa ##vers for people who need to get somewhere in tanzania ' ##s north ##- ##west ##ern city of mw ##anza . [SEP] [CLS] they seem to be the only way to beat traffic jam ##s . [SEP] [CLS] but when you get on the bike and wrap your arms around the driver , you are actually putting your life in his hands . [SEP] [CLS] in the first half of this year , there were more than 5 ##, ##00 ##0 road accidents in tanzania . [SEP] [CLS] more than a quarter of them were motorcycle accidents . [SEP] [CLS] bo ##da bo ##da drivers are often blamed for causing the problems on mw ##anza ' ##s roads . [SEP] [CLS] they might get you where you want to go quickly , but they have a reputation for driving reckless ##ly . [SEP] [CLS] there are hundreds of them competing for fares , which increases the risk of accidents . [SEP] [CLS] but that is also where trainee doctor marko hi ##ng ##i saw an opportunity to turn bo ##da bo ##da drivers into true life ##- ##sa ##vers . [SEP] [CLS] he was inspired by the fact that wherever there is a medical emergency in mw ##anza , there is likely to be a motorcycle taxi driver nearby . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we have human beings here and we can use them as volunteers to help , ' ##' says mr hi ##ng ##i , who works at a hospital in the city . [SEP] [CLS] he is also head of the tanzania rural health movement , which recruits bo ##da bo ##da drivers and turns them into first ##- ##res ##pon ##ders , acting like para ##med ##ics . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` in the past when somebody got injured , he bled while people looked at him until he died , ' ##' says an ##ice ##t mas ##e , one of mr hi ##ng ##i ' ##s volunteer drivers . [SEP] [CLS] now mr mas ##e zip ##s around mw ##anza wearing a fluorescent orange vest and a backpack full of bandages and other first ##- ##aid kit . [SEP] [CLS] he and the other volunteer drivers have been trained in basic first ##- ##aid , such as keeping airways open , stopping bleeding and sp ##lin ##ting fractured bones . [SEP] [CLS] the drivers also have mobile phones and are linked to a system called beacon . [SEP] [CLS] mw ##anza ' ##s fire station receives calls reporting emergencies . [SEP] [CLS] a dispatch ##er enters the details into the beacon software , which then sends a text message to everyone linked to the system .

[CLS] published in the lance ##t and backed by a number of major health organisations , it says stat ##ins lower heart attack and stroke risk . [SEP] [CLS] the review also suggests side effects such as muscle pain do occur , although in relatively few people . [SEP] [CLS] but critics say healthy people are un ##ne ##ces ##sari ##ly taking medication . [SEP] [CLS] stat ##ins reduce the build ##- ##up of fatty plaques that lead to block ##ages in blood vessels . [SEP] [CLS] according to the report authors : [SEP] [CLS] the lance ##t review , led by prof rory collins from the clinical trial service unit at the university of oxford , looked at the available evidence for the effects of taking an average 40 ##mg daily dose of stat ##ins in 10 ##, ##00 ##0 patients over five years . [SEP] [CLS] it suggested cho ##les ##terol levels would be lowered enough to prevent 1 ##, ##00 ##0 ` ##` major cardiovascular events ' ##' such as heart attacks , strokes and corona ##ry artery bypass ##es in people who had existing vascular disease - and 500 in people who were at risk due to age or other illnesses such as high blood pressure or diabetes . [SEP] [CLS] stephen sang ##ster , who lives in or ##ping ##ton with his wife and two children explains why he takes the drugs . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i ' ##ve been taking stat ##ins for three months now . [SEP] [CLS] my high cho ##les ##terol was picked up by a work health assessment . [SEP] [CLS] dietary changes made no impact . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` with my dad dying of heart attack young last year , stat ##ins give me comfort that they will probably give me a longer life . [SEP] [CLS] so i can live with the small chance of side effects . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` so far i ' ##ve only experienced a bit of di ##zziness , and i do n ##' ##t know even if that ' ##s related to stat ##ins . [SEP] [CLS] also it ' ##s better than the risk of a heart attack . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` my cho ##les ##terol was 9 ##. ##3 and within a month of taking stat ##ins it ' ##s back down to below four . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` cho ##les ##terol is a hidden danger . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s such a simple test . [SEP] [CLS] more people should be encouraged to take it .

[CLS] some fans and politicians were angry that pop ##pies were not worn by players . [SEP] [CLS] in a statement , ulster rugby said several other pro ##12 clubs had not worn a poppy during games at the weekend . [SEP] [CLS] it said its players had observed a minute ' ##s silence and it would hold a memorial service on tuesday . [SEP] [CLS] the belfast telegraph reported that some fans had described the absence as ` ##` shame ##ful ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] robert mccartney , a former soldier who runs the beyond the battlefield charity , told bbc radio ulster ' ##s talk ##back programme it was ` ##` an insult ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i honestly believe they did cause an insult yesterday , ' ##' he said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it is a mark of respect , the reason they are able to play the sport themselves is because of the freedom these men gave them and if they ca n ##' ##t put the poppy on their shirt for one day and show that respect , then they really did disgrace themselves yesterday . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we lost an awful lot of people in the wars and probably members of their family as well and for them not to wear it was a complete insult to the country . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] doug beat ##tie , an ulster unionist councillor and former army captain , said he believed remembrance was a ` ##` personal thing ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the ulster rugby team had a remembrance service on that day , they had a minute ' ##s silence before the match and everybody is complaining about the symbolism of wearing a poppy , well i just do n ##' ##t get it , ' ##' he added . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i do n ##' ##t like the word poppy fascism or poppy stalin ##ism , there are people who are passionate about the poppy and remembrance and me and robert have got more in common than we do n ##' ##t , but on this issue i feel that people should wear the poppy if they want to wear the poppy if they do n ##' ##t then they should not . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i would rather stand beside somebody who is wearing it for a reason than somebody who is wearing it because somebody has told them if you do n ##' ##t you are un ##pa ##tri ##otic .

[CLS] it ' ##s also making an impact on education , with plans to put 3d printers into schools in the united kingdom and the united states . [SEP] [CLS] these technologies hold massive potential for young people both in and out of school . [SEP] [CLS] schools are getting interested in this ` ##` rapid proto ##ty ##ping ' ##' technology . [SEP] [CLS] but there are still the usual barriers - access , funding , teacher awareness and confidence . [SEP] [CLS] however , many learners are getting 3d design whether or not their schools are ready . [SEP] [CLS] one of the most illuminating advocates is a 14 ##- ##year ##- ##old school ##girl from manchester in the uk . [SEP] [CLS] amy math ##er won the european commission ' ##s first european digital girl of the year award last year . [SEP] [CLS] the school ##girl has presented her ideas in front of expert audiences , including campus party at london ' ##s o ##2 arena , wired next generation and the royal society for the encouragement of arts - ##lr ##b ##- rs ##a - ##rr ##b ##- . [SEP] [CLS] amy got involved in coding and later 3d design after attending the manchester science festival when she was 11 . [SEP] [CLS] but the key inspiration for her work has been what is loosely termed the ` ##` digital maker ' ##' movement , a global drive to encourage young people to be creative with technology . [SEP] [CLS] this includes support from fa ##b lab in manchester . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` fa ##b lab ' ##' stands for a ` ##` fabrication laboratory ' ##' , where digital ideas are turned into products and prototypes . [SEP] [CLS] the fa ##b lab holds open days for the public and these allowed amy to use software and hardware not available in her school , such as 3d printers and laser cutter ##s . [SEP] [CLS] she uses 3d design and manufacturing techniques for her school g ##cs ##e product design course ##work . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` there are people always on hand with experience , people who live and breathe it , ' ##' she says . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` and there is a great community spirit so it ' ##s really , really easy to learn there and to go at your own pace and experiment . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] manchester ' ##s fa ##b lab was the first of nine in the uk , with the number expected to rise to 30 within three years .

[SEP] [CLS] af ##di is listed as an anti ##- ##mus ##lim group by the southern poverty law center , a civil rights group . [SEP] [CLS] a fl ##am ##boy ##ant rhetoric ##al style on social media , in which she is not afraid to be provocative and offensive , has recently powered pamela gel ##ler ' ##s rise . [SEP] [CLS] in may 2015 , ms gel ##ler played a key role in organising a conference on cartoons of the prophet muhammad in a suburb of dallas , where two gunmen were shot dead after opening fire outside the venue . [SEP] [CLS] in typically em ##ot ##ive language after the attack , she defended the decision to stage the exhibition .

[SEP] [CLS] in april 2015 , the af ##di was also in the headlines when it arranged for a controversial advertisement - which referred to muslims killing jews - to be displayed on new york ' ##s buses .

[SEP] [CLS] she has been denounced by critics as a ` ##` big ##oted blogger ' ##' , reportedly has no formal journalist ##ic qualifications and operates outside traditional washington power centres . [SEP] [CLS] ms gel ##ler insists that she is not against islam in general - only radical islam . [SEP] [CLS] however , expressing views that even her supporters have criticised as being excessive , she has , for instance , been quoted as describing the faith as a ` ##` gen ##oc ##idal ideology ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] she has equally strong views on numerous other issues - calling over the last decade for the removal of the dome of the rock in jerusalem where islamic tradition says the prophet muhammad ascended to heaven , and an end to president barack obama ' ##s healthcare reforms which she described as an ` ##` act of national rape ' ##' .

[SEP] [CLS] the incident damaged both cars , with rai ##kko ##nen fighting back to fifth behind the red bulls of dani ##il kv ##yat and daniel ric ##cia ##rdo . [SEP] [CLS] rai ##kko ##nen ' ##s rise through the field included passing hamilton in the closing stages , ferrari ' ##s decision to use soft tyres for the final stint as opposed to the medium ##s chosen by mercedes giving the finn an advantage as the brit ##on fought in vain to try to pass the williams of felipe mass ##a . [SEP] [CLS] hamilton will express his confidence at being able to er ##ode ro ##sberg ' ##s points lead and will expect his awful luck of the first three races to turn ##around - but the fact remains that no driver who has won the first three races of a season has failed to go on to claim the world championship . [SEP] [CLS] the race was shaped by an incident ##- ##pack ##ed opening , with a number of collisions on the first lap leading to the introduction of the safety car on lap four . [SEP] [CLS] by that stage , hamilton and rai ##kko ##nen had already pitted once to replace front wings damaged in first ##- ##cor ##ner collisions .

[SEP] [CLS] the uk is recognised for having the best wind resource in europe . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` one of the main messages from this report is that in a scenario with a higher content of wind energy , you are less re ##lian ##t on fossil fuels , ' ##' explained co ##- ##au ##thor sophie billing ##ton , a researcher from cambridge eco ##no ##metric ##s . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` this is a key message , particularly when you consider that the uk - for the past five years or so - has imported more gas than it has produced domestically .

[CLS] the pound has gained 1 % and although the stock market is down more than 2 % , a lot of that happened before theresa may called a snap election for 8 june . [SEP] [CLS] still , market watch ##ers are reading the tea leaves and have made a few observations . [SEP] [CLS] since the big fall in sterling after the referendum result , the pound has tended to rise at times when a softer br ##ex ##it has looked more likely and vice versa . [SEP] [CLS] today ' ##s rise in the pound suggests markets are betting that theresa may will - ##lr ##b ##- a - ##rr ##b ##- win and - ##lr ##b ##- b - ##rr ##b ##- win a bigger majority than she currently has , which - ##lr ##b ##- c - ##rr ##b ##- will make her less dependent on hard ##line euros ##ce ##ptic ##s in her own party . [SEP] [CLS] the theory goes that all this will allow her room to deliver a softer br ##ex ##it , which will be less of a shock to the economic system - hence the pound strengthen ##s . [SEP] [CLS] the stock market is falling because most of the uk ' ##s largest companies make their money in foreign cu ##rre ##ncies . [SEP] [CLS] as the pound rises , those foreign earnings are worth less in sterling terms . [SEP] [CLS] that is the way markets are reading it today , but as we know , markets can be pretty terrible at reading politics and it is certainly not a done deal that theresa may will use any consolidation of her position as an opportunity to pe ##ddle a softer line on br ##ex ##it . [SEP] [CLS] one thing an election in june does give her - if she wins - is more breathing room . [SEP] [CLS] she will be under less pressure to deliver a ` ##` clean ' ##' br ##ex ##it in 2019 without the deadline of another election in 2020 bearing down on her . [SEP] [CLS] facing the country again while possibly still en ##mes ##hed in tor ##tu ##ous negotiation - ##lr ##b ##- with potentially little control over immigration by then - ##rr ##b ##- was an una ##ppe ##aling political prospect . [SEP] [CLS] business groups have been broadly supportive of the move . [SEP] [CLS] all other things being equal , businesses prefer the additional certainty that a government with a larger majority can provide . [SEP] [CLS] the ee ##f said ` ##` a fresh and stable mandate from the country can only provide greater certainty about the future direction of travel for policy ' ##' , while the cb ##i had a cooler response , saying : ` ##` distraction from the urgent priorities of seeking the best eu deal and improving uk productivity must be kept to a minimum .

[CLS] a report by the food and agriculture organization said agriculture accounted for about a fifth of emissions , which it said needed to be reduced . [SEP] [CLS] the state of food & agriculture 2016 report said ` ##` business as usual ' ##' would leave millions at risk from hunger . [SEP] [CLS] last year , nations adopted a un goal of ending hunger by 203 ##0 . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the climate is changing , so agriculture must change too , ' ##' explained rob voss , director of fa ##o ' ##s agricultural development economics division . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we are saying that because agriculture is already very affected by the impacts of climate change , particularly the countries in the tropical zones . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` also , agriculture is contributing itself to about one fifth of the global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases , ' ##' mr voss , who headed the team that produced the fa ##o state of food & agriculture 2016 report , added . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` if we continue along the present pathways then we will not be able to - ##ls ##b ##- deliver - ##rs ##b ##- food security around the world and we will not be able to stab ##ilis ##e the climate . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] as a result , he told bbc news , there was a need for ` ##` major changes ' ##' to take place in the sector . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` one of the challenges is agriculture itself . [SEP] [CLS] as soon as we shovel the ground then we are already releasing greenhouse gas emissions . [SEP] [CLS] also , as it is so dependent on water and quality of land , any impact from the change in climate has a direct impact . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] therefore , he said , the challenge was bearing these changes in mind and looking at ways to shift to a more sustainable footing . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` a lot of the technologies that are available that allow us to do things differently do face a number of hurdles , especially when it comes to small ##holder farmers in developing countries . ' [SEP] [CLS] these include the cost of changing the way farmers produce their food ; knowledge of shifting to the novel ways of farming ; urban ##isation ; access to water . [SEP] [CLS] in terms of making the change to deliver a robust global food system , mr voss said the report highlighted four steps that could be taken : [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` first , put in the steps that would help farmers switch to more sustainable practices , such as more efficient use of fe ##rti ##lizer ##s and using heat tolerant and drought resistant crop varieties . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] he added that management systems , such as ag ##ro ##for ##est

' ##' [SEP] [CLS] talking about the impact on the capital ' ##s image , one year ahead of the olympic games , he said : ` ##` it ' ##s pretty rotten for london , it does not look good .

[CLS] in a study on mice , hs ##p ##90 inhibitors were found to strip cancer cells of defences against hormone treatments . [SEP] [CLS] this makes the drugs particularly promising for treating drug ##- ##res ##istan ##t cancers , the research team said . [SEP] [CLS] prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the uk . [SEP] [CLS] about one in eight men will get prostate cancer at some point in their lives . [SEP] [CLS] it mainly affects men over the age of 50 . [SEP] [CLS] the cancer can sometimes be treated successfully with hormone treatments , which target and ##rogen receptors linked to the growth of male hormones called and ##rogen ##s . [SEP] [CLS] but some prostate cancers do n ##' ##t work that way . [SEP] [CLS] instead they create an abnormal form of and ##rogen receptor which is not linked to the growth of hormones and therefore does not respond to standard hormone treatment . [SEP] [CLS] this is the most common form of resistance in prostate cancer which leads to aggressive , difficult ##- ##to ##- ##tre ##at cancers . [SEP] [CLS] the latest research , published in the journal cancer research , found that a new class of drugs reduced production of both receptors . [SEP] [CLS] professor paul work ##man , study author and chief executive of the institute of cancer research , said it was an exciting discovery . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we call hs ##p ##90 inhibitors ` network drugs ' because they tackle several of the signals that are hi ##jack ##ed in cancer all at once , across a network rather than just a single signalling pathway . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` these drugs can hit cancer harder than those targeting only one protein , and look promising for preventing or overcoming drug resistance . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] prof work ##man said the next step was to test the hs ##p ##90 inhibitors in clinical trials on patients with aggressive , drug ##- ##res ##istan ##t prostate cancer . [SEP] [CLS] prof johann de bono , a professor of experimental cancer medicine at the institute of cancer research , said : ` ##` these drugs are already in clinical trials for several types of cancer , and i am excited that our work suggests they could also benefit men with prostate cancer who have otherwise run out of treatment options .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it was only a week ago that the north korean government now claims that he was in a coma for almost all of that time . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` even if you believe their explanation of bot ##uli ##sm and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we do n ##' ##t - there ' ##s no excuse for a civil ##ised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] otto warm ##bie ##r , an economics student from the university of virginia , was arrested in january 2016 while visiting north korea as a tourist . [SEP] [CLS] bot ##uli ##sm is a type of poisoning which can cause total body paralysis , difficulty in breathing and death in some cases . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s caused by the cl ##ost ##rid ##ium bot ##ulin ##um bacteria , but the symptoms of bot ##uli ##sm are not from the bacteria themselves . [SEP] [CLS] instead , the microscopic organisms produce a powerful toxin which attacks the nervous system and causes paralysis . [SEP] [CLS] that poison is called bot ##ulin ##um - which you may know for its commercial use in bot ##ox , which removes wr ##inkles by para ##ly ##sing facial muscles . [SEP] [CLS] bot ##uli ##sm is contracted in two ways in adults - by eating food contaminated with the toxin , or through wounds . [SEP] [CLS] the food ##borne method happens when the bacteria are tin ##ned or stored in food in another way that de ##pr ##ives them from air - ##lr ##b ##- which is when they produce the poison - ##rr ##b ##- . [SEP] [CLS] this rarely happens in modern western food production , but is what north korea claims happened to mr warm ##bie ##r . [SEP] [CLS] he was given a 15 ##- ##year prison sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel .

[CLS] a team from cardiff university has spent the last month ex ##ca ##vating ca ##era ##u hill fort near ely . [SEP] [CLS] it is smaller than its contemporaries at pen ##ty ##rch and pont ##pre ##nna ##u and had been thought to be inferior in status . [SEP] [CLS] but structures and artefacts so far unearthed suggest the fort remained important well into the roman era . [SEP] [CLS] until now it has been thought that the fort was purely a stronghold of the si ##lu ##rian tribe who inhabited this part of wales from around the 5th century bc , falling into di ##sus ##e once they were finally defeated by the romans , circa 75 ad . [SEP] [CLS] however the initial dig this summer has uncovered a considerable amount of new information , including three iron age round ##houses and a stone ##- ##bu ##il ##t pathway that runs around the edge of the hill fort , suggesting to the experts a possible domestic and ##/ ##or political dimension . [SEP] [CLS] also , the mix of si ##lu ##rian and roman artefacts may indicate that the fort was occupied much later than had been thought , and that the two groups might have mingled there . [SEP] [CLS] dr oliver davis , from the university ' ##s school of history , archaeology and religion , said : ` ##` people think of these sites as defensive structures , but our attention is turning to whether the people who lived there were actually developing a community or collective identity for themselves . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` our community excavations show that occupation at the site continued until at least the third century ad , well into the roman period . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` domestic life is indicated by the discovery of simple tools and ceramics from all periods . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` a glimpse of the personality of the inhabitants is provided by the discovery of a glass bea ##d of iron age date and an enamel ##led disc bro ##och of roman date . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` both these objects indicate that individuals were concerned with their appearance , and that life in the past was a little more colourful than we sometimes think . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` over the past month the team has also examined the inner of the three ramp ##arts that surround the hill fort . [SEP] [CLS] these ramp ##arts and their associated ditch ##es were unlikely to have been built just for defence . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] but as well as colour from the past , dave horton , of the community organisation action in ca ##era ##u and ely , said the way local residents have had a hand in the discoveries has also lent a little colour to the present .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` a lot of things are happening in the heads of the players and in the first 10 or 15 minutes we were not so good . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] van gaa ##l felt his side improved as the first half went on and could have scored more goals . [SEP] [CLS] but he added : ` ##` in the second half we did n ##' ##t win any duel ##s , any second balls . [SEP] [CLS] you can not afford a second goal , but we could have scored also . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` jesse ling ##ard had two remarkable chances . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] at the end of the game , united fans in the mc ##h arena made it clear they were not impressed with their side ' ##s display . [SEP] [CLS] van gaa ##l accepted the second ##- ##hal ##f performance was not good enough , but defended the attitude of his players . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the fans can critic ##ise , ' ##' he said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` they can do it because when you see the second half , maybe they are right . [SEP] [CLS] we have to improve and then the fans shall support us again . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` all the players want to perform in an excellent way . [SEP] [CLS] it is not a case of attitude . [SEP] [CLS] we were not winning the second balls - that is my analysis .

[SEP] [CLS] he was also handed a three ##- ##year sentence for the serious injury charges , which will run concurrently , and has been banned from driving for eight years . [SEP] [CLS] the recorder of cardiff , el ##eri rees qc , told collins : ` ##` you have never acknowledged any fault despite overwhelming evidence it was entirely your fault . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the obvious inference is that you allowed yourself to become distracted .

[SEP] [CLS] the judge criticised his ` ##` cavalier attitude ' ##' to both his own safety and that if others , adding the lack of a car booster seat had contributed to joseph ' ##s injuries . [SEP] [CLS] the trial heard collins - who had denied all the charges - was driving a borrowed ford focus carrying his partner laura bright , 23 , her mother michelle holmes , joseph , and the couple ' ##s two ##- ##year ##- ##old daughter at the time of the crash .

[CLS] in an election pledge , labour said giving working parents 30 hours free child ##care a week for 48 weeks of the year would cost an extra # 84 ##m annually . [SEP] [CLS] economist gillian paul ##l told bbc wales the ` ##` upper limit ' ##' could reach # 200 ##m if ` ##` nearly all ' ##' parents took up the offer . [SEP] [CLS] the welsh government said it was currently anal ##ys ##ing the likely costs .

[SEP] [CLS] however , ms paul ##l warned that she thought the policy was unlikely to encourage many non ##- ##working parents to take up jobs . [SEP] [CLS] the welsh government insists the policy will remove one of the ` ##` major barriers to employment ' ##' .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the cost estimate - ##ls ##b ##- in the report - ##rs ##b ##- is based on a very small response in working behaviour , ' ##' she told the sunday politics wales programme . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` if there is a bigger response , the cost could be considerably higher .

[SEP] [CLS] shortly before his death , he authorised the film to be made which was given its premiere in southern scotland . [SEP] [CLS] ak ##ong ri ##np ##oche was installed as abbot of a monastery in eastern tibet at the age of just four having been identified as the rein ##car ##nation of the previous abbot . [SEP] [CLS] when he was 19 , with china having occupied tibet and tensions between the countries at their height , he joined a freedom walk over the himalayas to india . [SEP] [CLS] it took 10 months and of the 200 people who started , only 15 survived . [SEP] [CLS] ak ##ong eventually made his way to the uk in 1959 and acquired an old farmhouse at es ##k ##dale ##mu ##ir where sam ##ye ling was founded in 1967 . [SEP] [CLS] the film ' ##s executive producer vin harris told bbc radio ' ##s good morning scotland programme : ` ##` i think they travelled around lots of places , there was a story that it kind of reminded them of tibet . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` there was someone there who was running a spiritual centre and he was ready to move on so they basically took it over . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` they were very much welcomed , particularly in du ##m ##fr ##ies , ri ##np ##oche made his family life there and had very good friends here . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] sam ##ye ling was the first buddhist monastery to be founded in europe and students later included david bowie and leonard cohen . [SEP] [CLS] it has now grown into a large complex for the study and teaching of buddhism , with a vast temple at its heart . [SEP] [CLS] from there , ak ##ong spearheaded a range of projects including ro ##k ##pa international , which carries out humanitarian work in tibet , nepal , india and africa . [SEP] [CLS] it was while in china in october 2013 that he was murdered , aged 73 , but before his death he authorised the film of his life to be made . [SEP] [CLS] its premiere at sam ##ye ling was attended by the current abbot , ak ##ong ' ##s younger brother lama yes ##he los ##al ri ##np ##oche . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we feel that the film is more a message of hope actually - a celebration of his life , ' ##' mr harris said .

[CLS] the local authority involved , the london borough of tower hamlets , rejected a report in the times newspaper that said the foster family did not speak english . [SEP] [CLS] it also disputed other details . [SEP] [CLS] reporting restrictions are in place to protect the identity of the girl .

[SEP] [CLS] according to the foster ##ing agency ta ##ct care , while muslim families do occasionally foster non ##- ##mus ##lim children , it is less usual for non ##- ##mus ##lim families to foster muslim children . [SEP] [CLS] there are no official statistics available on the religion of foster ##ed children or their care ##rs , but we do have some information about ethnicity . [SEP] [CLS] government figures show nine local authorities reported having no long ##- ##ter ##m foster care ##rs from minority ethnic groups last year , but all reported placing minority ethnic children with their foster ##ing service . [SEP] [CLS] in 2015 ##- ##16 , 84 % of long ##- ##ter ##m foster care ##rs were white compared with about 77 % of foster ##ed children . [SEP] [CLS] foster care ##rs can access training and are expected to demonstrate how they are meeting the legal standards of care . [SEP] [CLS] for example , someone caring for a vulnerable child will have to provide evidence that they understand the principle of ` ##` equality , inclusion and anti ##- ##dis ##cr ##imi ##nator ##y practice ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] when a child needs to be accommodated in a foster placement , a council usually has less than 24 hours to find them a home , meaning there is often not a lot of choice between which approved foster care ##r they are placed with . [SEP] [CLS] there are other considerations , too , like making sure the child is near their school . [SEP] [CLS] there are very few hard and fast rules di ##cta ##ting who can become a foster care ##r . [SEP] [CLS] each individual applying to care for vulnerable children has to undergo a comprehensive assessment by a council or independent foster ##ing agency . [SEP] [CLS] this can take about 15 ##- ##20 weeks , during which they will be expected to allow their home , lifestyle , current and past relationships to be sc ##rut ##ini ##sed . [SEP] [CLS] the basic criteria required by most foster ##ing agencies and councils are : [SEP] [CLS] age , marital status , ethnicity and sexuality will not exclude someone from being a foster care ##r . [SEP] [CLS] but some of these elements may be taken into account , depending on the individual circumstances - the primary consideration is what is best for the child .

[CLS] in his long ##- ##shot appeal , simpson argues his defence lawyer was ineffective . [SEP] [CLS] the 65 ##- ##year ##- ##old was convicted of the robbery of what he said were stolen articles of personal memorabilia . [SEP] [CLS] separately , simpson was acquitted in 1995 of the murder of his former wife and her friend in los angeles . [SEP] [CLS] the former national football league running back is expected to testify during the five ##- ##day hearing , which began on monday . [SEP] [CLS] simpson , who was shack ##led in court , is more than four years into a minimum nine ##- ##year to 33 ##- ##year prison sentence . [SEP] [CLS] in 2007 , the former football player was accompanied by five other men as he tried to reclaim family pictures and football ##s pe ##ddled by sport memorabilia dealers in a las vegas hotel room . [SEP] [CLS] during the incident , two of simpson ' ##s alleged co ##- ##con ##sp ##ira ##tors carried guns . [SEP] [CLS] simpson says former defence lawyer , yale gala ##nte ##r , was ineffective at the subsequent trial because he had an personal interest in keeping private his own advice to simpson . [SEP] [CLS] mr gala ##nte ##r , according to simpson , had repeatedly assured him that he could take back items related to his sporting career - items simpson believed had been stolen - as long as no ##- ##one tres ##pass ##ed and no force was used . [SEP] [CLS] the defence lawyer continued to conceal that he had been a witness to the crime , including during an appeal to a state court in 2010 , simpson says . [SEP] [CLS] in a sworn statement out ##lining his planned testimony , simpson says mr gala ##nte ##r ` ##` vigorously discouraged ' ##' him from testify ##ing and never told him that prosecutors were willing to let him plead guilty to charges that would have brought a two ##- ##year minimum prison term . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` he consistently told me the state could not prove its case because i acted within my rights in re ##taking my own property , ' ##' simpson said . [SEP] [CLS] dr norman roi ##tman , a las vegas psychiatrist , testified on monday that simpson ' ##s perception of what took place at the hotel room might have been mud ##dled by football brain injuries as well as the effects of several vodka and cr ##an ##berry juice cocktail ##s . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` in those situations , people may focus on objects in front of them and be oblivious to other things , ' ##' mr roi ##tman said . [SEP] [CLS] appeals for a new trial because of ineffective counsel are seldom granted , but simpson ' ##s history as a murder defendant in a widely ##- ##tel ##ev ##ised 1995 trial could affect the outcome

[CLS] the then ##- ##pr ##ime minister called the german leader days before the eu referendum , as opinion polls seemed to show voters moving to the leave camp .

[SEP] [CLS] no 10 decided it could be portrayed by vote leave as a sign of weakness .

[SEP] [CLS] the former prime minister approached his german counterpart after vote leave had dominated the campaign in the wake of the publication of official migration statistics at the end of may . [SEP] [CLS] these showed the government had once again failed to meet its net migration target . [SEP] [CLS] the idea of a joint statement by eu leaders was eventually she ##lved . [SEP] [CLS] news ##night understands that at an eu summit after the eu referendum the german chancellor made it clear to mr cameron that there could be no compromise for eu members on rules governing the free movement of people . [SEP] [CLS] the appeal by mr cameron to mrs mer ##kel followed a discussion among senior downing street aide ##s who said that the prime minister should reprise the success of ` ##` the vow ' ##' in the scottish independence referendum . [SEP] [CLS] mr cameron and the other main westminster parties had moved to shore up the pro ##- ##uk vote in the final stages of that campaign in 2014 by pl ##edging to dev ##ol ##ve further powers to the scottish parliament . [SEP] [CLS] the move considered by the prime minister , revealed by news ##night in an investigation into the eu referendum campaign , shows that downing street came close to ripping up a key element of its strategy in the final stages . [SEP] [CLS] this was to focus on the economic risks of br ##ex ##it and to avoid discussing immigration on the grounds that vote leave would always say that the uk could never control its borders while it remained a member of the eu .

[SEP] [CLS] the institute of directors said it would be a big cost for many companies , including medium ##- ##si ##zed firms . [SEP] [CLS] the cb ##i said it was a significant extra tax for business that would hit many smaller companies . [SEP] [CLS] only businesses with a wage bill of more than # 3 ##m will pay the levy , which the government said would exempt 98 % of employers . [SEP] [CLS] mr osborne told the commons : ` ##` it ' ##s a huge reform to raise the skills of the nation and address one of the enduring weaknesses of the british economy . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] but institute of directors director ##- ##gen ##eral simon walker said : ` ##` we are very concerned by the government ' ##s assumption that a quarter of the money collected will be spent on just administering the levy . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` firms have been promised they will get back more than they put in , but it ' ##s not clear how this will happen if so much is being lost in bureaucracy .

[CLS] but such apparently excessive pay is not a new concern . [SEP] [CLS] back in the early 1960s the conservative government was interested in cutting back the sprawling and loss ##- ##making british railway network . [SEP] [CLS] the man who was chosen for the job was a senior ic ##i director called dr richard beech ##ing . [SEP] [CLS] he was appointed as chairman of the new british railways board in 1961 and two years later published his first , and infamous , report on ` ##` the res ##ha ##ping of british railways ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] even before he devised his controversial plans for pr ##uni ##ng british rail , there was another controversy , at least in the newspapers - over his pay . [SEP] [CLS] the times reported in 1961 that dr beech ##ing would be paid the same as his ic ##i salary while he was on second ##ment to the government . [SEP] [CLS] that was the then huge figure of # 24 ##, ##00 ##0 , which was thirty times higher than the average annual uk salary of just over # 800 a year and # 14 ##, ##00 ##0 more than that of the then prime minister harold macmillan . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` is this man - or any man - worth pounds 450 a week ? ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] let ' ##s fast forward a couple more decades to the 1980s . [SEP] [CLS] it was then that the current trend for spiral ##ling executive pay took root . [SEP] [CLS] according to some analyses , the touch paper was lit by the boom in city salaries that followed the big bang of financial der ##eg ##ulation in 1986 . [SEP] [CLS] that prompted not only a bidding war for city traders and the like , but attracted a rush of us investment banks who set up in london . [SEP] [CLS] they brought with them american ##- ##sty ##le pumped ##- ##up salaries , so fitting for the ` ##` greed is good ' ##' et ##hos famously es ##po ##used by the character gordon ge ##kko in the film wall street .

' ##' [SEP] [CLS] celtic ' ##s 18 ##- ##year ##- ##old left ##- ##back , ki ##eran tierney , was one of six players - including aberdeen midfielder kenny mclean - to be called into a scotland squad for the first time .

[SEP] [CLS] for his part , the 92 ##- ##year ##- ##old has long considered talk of a future in which he is absent as tan ##tam ##ount to treason . [SEP] [CLS] he is still the president and there is no vacancy for that post and the people , he says , should not be ` ##` confused by the confusion ##ists ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] and for the last two years , his younger wife grace has forced her will into the debate , seen one vice ##- ##pres ##ide ##nt fired and is gunn ##ing for another while declaring just the other day that if needs be , mr mug ##abe would continue to rule from his grave . [SEP] [CLS] hyper ##in ##fl ##ation and zimbabwe ' ##s famous billion and trillion dollar notes are a thing of the past , but now hard currency has been in short supply . [SEP] [CLS] the liberal ##ised dollar economy of 2009 is on the brink of collapse , there are long queue ##s at banks which have limited the amounts people can withdraw and there are plans to introduce new bond notes to ease the cash ##- ##flow crisis . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` no inquiry , no arrests - just a $ 15 ##bn hole in the nation ' ##s co ##ffer ##s ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the country is import ##ing more than it is selling , unemployment continues to so ##ar , while a proud history of good education has only produced millions of vendors selling cheap goods and food to their fellow impoverished citizens as businesses fold around them . [SEP] [CLS] the country ' ##s major hospitals have at times gone without water and electricity , and it surprises no ##- ##one that the president ' ##s daughter gave birth in singapore rather than a local maternity hospital ; and that morgan ts ##van ##gi ##rai , the leader of the official opposition , has been undergoing treatment in a south african hospital . [SEP] [CLS] the need for food is as real to millions as is the drought affecting all of southern africa , and the politicians ' pre ##oc ##cup ##ation with the tragic soap opera of mr mug ##abe ' ##s
[CLS] it was back in 2008 , and james watt and martin dick ##ie ' ##s then tiny brewery at fraser ##burgh , north ##- ##ea ##st scotland , was little over a year old and struggling . [SEP] [CLS] selling their us ##- ##sty ##le craft beers from the back of their van at farmers ' markets , they were missing payments on their # 20 ##, ##00 ##0 - ##lr ##b ##- $ 30 ##, ##00 ##0 - ##rr ##b ##- bank loan . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we were selling a couple of cases on a good day , and losing money , ' ##' says mr watt , now 32 . [SEP] [CLS] and then they decided to enter a bottled beer competition organised by supermarket group te ##sco . [SEP] [CLS] brew ##dog won first , second , third , and fourth place . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` so we went down to te ##sco ' ##s headquarters - ##ls ##b ##- just north of london - ##rs ##b ##- , and they told us they loved our beer and wanted to put us in 500 shops , buying 2 ##, ##00 ##0 cases a week , ' ##' says mr watt . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we put on our best poker faces and said ` no problem ' . [SEP] [CLS] yet we were just two guys filling bottles by hand . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] with te ##sco wanting first deliveries in four months ' time , mr watt and mr dick ##ie , also now 32 , went to their bank to ask for another # 150 ##, ##00 ##0 , so they could quickly install a bot ##tling line , and expand production . [SEP] [CLS] but failing to meet the payments on their existing loan , the bank said a firm ` ##` no ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] so the business partners went to another lend ##er , and lied . [SEP] [CLS] mr watt says : ` ##` we said that our bank had offered us an amazing deal , but that if you can match it we ' ##ll switch , and they went for it . [SEP] [CLS] you have got to do what you have to do . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] with brew ##dog now being able to increase its brewing facilities , it was able to start supplying te ##sco on time with bottles of its punk ipa . [SEP] [CLS] the beer was an immediate hit , and the other uk supermarkets soon followed suit . [SEP] [CLS] fast forward to 2014 , and brew ##dog is due to see its turnover top # 32 ##m this year . [SEP] [CLS] it employs 357 people , and as well as continuing to supply the likes of te ##sco uk ##- ##wide , it owns 25 bars , 18 across the uk , and seven abroad . [SEP] [CLS] and now based
[CLS] his aim was to give children in rural areas an access to education . [SEP] [CLS] as a member of non ##- ##pro ##fi ##t organisation e ##- ##ed ##uca ##tion project , he travelled across the country for the next year . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i filmed some of the best teachers ' classes in big cities , burned them onto dvds and showed them to students in rural areas , ' ##' he says . [SEP] [CLS] he chose dvds because internet connection was hard to come by . [SEP] [CLS] in the first year , dog ##a visited more than 700 students in five schools . [SEP] [CLS] the examination results at those schools improved by 46 % . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` in developed countries , kids complain about having to do homework , but these rwanda ##n children were thrilled to be able to learn , which made me happy . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] during one of his trips , he noticed piles of food that were in storage . [SEP] [CLS] farmers were too poor to transport them to big cities . [SEP] [CLS] through united nations workers whom he met in rwanda , mr ma ##ki ##ura decided to facilitate the transport of food between the farmers and hundreds of thousands of refugees who were fleeing the civil war in neighbouring democratic republic of congo . [SEP] [CLS] that was less than two years ago . [SEP] [CLS] today , he is based in bangkok where he has started his own company . [SEP] [CLS] his passion remains the same : to raise the living standards of people in developing countries . [SEP] [CLS] this time he ' ##s doing it through a mobile phone application called personal data bank . [SEP] [CLS] the app is still in the early ##- ##dev ##elo ##pment stage , but the aim is to build a more efficient infrastructure by anal ##ys ##ing the locations of people who are using the app . [SEP] [CLS] mr ma ##ki ##ura is an at ##yp ##ical japanese youth . [SEP] [CLS] above all , he is not afraid to take risks . [SEP] [CLS] and his global vision and entrepreneur ##ial spirit are exactly what the japanese government wants to encourage . [SEP] [CLS] today , japan has one of the lowest levels of entrepreneurship in the developed world , according to the global entrepreneurship monitor . [SEP] [CLS] there are a number of obstacles . [SEP] [CLS] japan has long lacked venture capitalist ##s who tend to invest in start ##- ##ups elsewhere in the world . [SEP] [CLS] and approaching banks for financing help , is a big challenge for entrepreneurs .

[CLS] vi ##kki thompson , 21 , was found dead in her cell at hm ##p leeds in 2015 with a liga ##ture around her neck . [SEP] [CLS] robert steele told the hearing in wakefield miss thompson wrote to him while in prison saying : ` ##` i know i ' ##m going to do something silly . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] giving evidence he said : ` ##` i believe she should n ##' ##t have been in a male prison . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the jury in ##quest was also told miss thompson , from kei ##gh ##ley , had repeatedly told prison and court escort staff that she would be ` ##` carried out in a box ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] mr steele said he spoke to her on the phone while she was in prison and she told him she wanted to move to a women ' ##s prison that and her solicitor ##s were waiting for her to make a formal application to the governor . [SEP] [CLS] mr steele also said he received a letter from his partner which said : ` ##` i do n ##' ##t think i can last very long in here . [SEP] [CLS] i ca n ##' ##t sleep at night . [SEP] [CLS] i just feel like i wo n ##' ##t be here no more . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` i know i ' ##m going to do something silly . [SEP] [CLS] i do n ##' ##t want to but i ca n ##' ##t do this . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] but , in a statement read to the court , miss thompson ' ##s mother lisa harrison said her daughter did not say she had a problem being in a men ' ##s prison . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` vi ##kki did n ##' ##t like prison but who does ? ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` she never said anything to me about it being the wrong prison for her . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] the in ##quest heard miss thompson had identified as female since she was 10 years old but had never had any surgical or hormone treatment . [SEP] [CLS] she did not have a gender recognition certificate establishing her female identity so she was sent to a men ' ##s prison . [SEP] [CLS] coroner jonathan leach said the in ##quest would examine a number of issues including the suit ##ability of the ` ##` prison accommodation ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] the jury was told that after an extensive risk assessment process miss thompson was initially put in e ##- ##wing rather than a ##- ##wing , where vulnerable prisoners were housed , and placed on a one ##- ##ho ##ur suicide watch . [SEP] [CLS] mr leach said this decision was taken because it was thought she might be under more risk on a ##- ##wing due to the number of sex offenders
[CLS] for the media - both in pakistan and abroad - the issue is clear enough : the pakistani taliban did it . [SEP] [CLS] not only has the organisation claimed the attacks . [SEP] [CLS] but the intelligence service is ##i also recorded real time messages from handler ##s to the gunmen in the school . [SEP] [CLS] those messages , the is ##i has told journalists , came from the phones of afghan ##- ##base ##d , pakistani taliban organise ##rs . [SEP] [CLS] but in peshawar even people who witnessed the attack hesitate to blame the taliban by name . [SEP] [CLS] they not only fear rep ##ris ##als but are also following the he ##sit ##ancy of a political elite that remains largely unwilling to name and condemn the pakistani taliban in une ##qui ##vo ##cal terms . [SEP] [CLS] even on the day of the peshawar school massacre , the prime minister na ##wa ##z sharif , failed to condemn the taliban by name . [SEP] [CLS] he referred only to ` ##` terrorists ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] an alternative narrative relating the school attacks is already emerging : rumours are circulating on social media and on the streets that it was the work of indian or afghan intelligence agencies . [SEP] [CLS] the fact that some of the attackers appear to have come from central asia lend ##s weight to suggestions that there was a foreign hand in the attacks . [SEP] [CLS] the emerging analysis of the school massacre echoes that which occurred after the shooting of mala ##la you ##sa ##f ##zai . [SEP] [CLS] initial shock eventually transformed to the almost mainstream view in pakistan today that mala ##la is a western st ##oo ##ge . [SEP] [CLS] that ' ##s not to say the school massacre has had no impact on public opinion . [SEP] [CLS] when a radical cleric attempted to justify the attack this week , protest ##ors gathered outside his mosque in islamabad chanting anti taliban slogan ##s . [SEP] [CLS] but there is still no big name politician prepared openly to lead people with that point of view . [SEP] [CLS] that is in part because the pakistan ' ##s civil and military elites are so divided and dysfunction ##al . [SEP] [CLS] the politicians have a number of reasons for leaving the fight against the pakistan taliban - ##lr ##b ##- tt ##p - ##rr ##b ##- to the army . [SEP] [CLS] privately , government ministers argue that the army ' ##s total control of security policy means it is unreasonable for the generals to expect the civilians to take responsibility for what the army decides to do . [SEP] [CLS] the politicians are anyway deeply suspicious of an army that has frequently mounted coup ##s to overthrow elected governments . [SEP] [CLS] the current prime minister na ##wa ##z sharif , was kicked out of power , put in a dungeon and
[CLS] but if you thought that meant he was about to announce some pre ##- ##ele ##ction give ##away ##s in order to woo und ##ec ##ided voters you ' ##re likely to be disappointed . [SEP] [CLS] some areas did see announcements that are aimed at stimulating growth - the chancellor announced provisional agreement had been struck to allow greater manchester to keep 100 % of the additional growth in local business as part of the government ' ##s drive to build a ` ##` northern powerhouse ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] in fact his speech was pepper ##ed with place names - from funding to help boost the oil industry in aberdeen to a # 1 billion world ##- ##fi ##rst scheme to provide green energy from the tides of the severn estuary and # 60 million of funding for energy research in the midlands . [SEP] [CLS] but , despite the fact he was on his feet for over an hour , the south east region was conspicuous by its absence in his budget speech . [SEP] [CLS] measures that had been trailed , such as increasing inheritance tax , which would have helped those with properties in the south east which have increased in value , are now going to be reviewed before any changes are implemented . [SEP] [CLS] most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need adobe reader [SEP] [CLS] there are measures which will be welcomed . [SEP] [CLS] the budget book recognised that housing remains a significant challenge across the south east . [SEP] [CLS] the government created an urban development corporation to drive forward development of a new garden city in e ##bbs ##fleet . [SEP] [CLS] board members are due to be announced and it ' ##s due to be up and running by next month . [SEP] [CLS] for individuals , he announced a new isa to help first time buyers - those who save # 12 ##, ##00 ##0 will see their savings increased by # 3 ##, ##00 ##0 in order to help them onto the housing ladder . [SEP] [CLS] but , other than that , there was very little to bring cheer . [SEP] [CLS] it ' ##s always said george osborne delivers very political budgets and this one was no different . [SEP] [CLS] i think he ' ##s taken the calculated risk that levels of income in the south east remain a lot higher than in other parts of the country so therefore it will be of greater benefit to help boost the economy in places like the north west and yorkshire , rather than kent or sussex . [SEP] [CLS] also , when you look at the raw politics of this region ' ##s 29 mps , 25 of them are conservatives . [SEP] [CLS] labour has so far failed to make the resurgence in the south east they would have liked ahead of this election . [SEP]
[CLS] islamic tradition requires the dead to be buried as soon as possible , unless an autopsy is required . [SEP] [CLS] the us military took this requirement very seriously , burying the body within hours . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` traditional procedures for islamic burial were followed , ' ##' an official said . [SEP] [CLS] religious rites were carried out on the deck of a us aircraft carrier , the uss carl vin ##son . [SEP] [CLS] the body , sh ##roud ##ed in a white sheet and placed in a weighted bag , was then positioned on a flat board , tipped up , and eased into the arabian sea . [SEP] [CLS] this occurred at 06 ##00 ##gm ##t , approximately 12 hours after the fire ##fight during which os ##ama bin laden was shot in the head . [SEP] [CLS] after this first shot , reports abc news ' the b ##lot ##ter , he was shot again , to make sure that he was dead . [SEP] [CLS] [UNK] $ ¬ the body was then flown to afghanistan and bin laden ' ##s identity was confirmed . [SEP] [CLS] officials say a dna sample was taken that matched that of several other family members . [SEP] [CLS] some sources say facial recognition technology was also used . [SEP] [CLS] from afghanistan , the body was , it appears , flown to the uss carl vin ##son . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` a military officer read prepared religious remarks , which were translated into arabic by a native speaker , ' ##' a us defence official said . [SEP] [CLS] according to uk ##- ##base ##d imam dr abdul ##jali ##l sa ##ji ##d , chairman of the muslim council for religious & racial harmony , four key steps need to be followed : [SEP] [CLS] there is no necessity for an imam to be present , he says , but the procedures should be carried out by muslims at least one of whom ` ##` knows the minimum basic muslim law of burial ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] whether any such person was present is impossible to know , he says , based on the limited information provided . [SEP] [CLS] but he also questions whether sea burial was appropriate in this case . [SEP] [CLS] it is correct to carry out a burial at sea when someone dies on a sea journey , he says , but in this case there was no sound reason for it . [SEP] [CLS] the us authorities could surely have found someone - a member of the extensive bin laden family , or even one of the many supporters of his ` ##` evil ' ##' ideology - who would have been prepared to give the body a proper burial , he argues . [SEP] [CLS] his words were echoed by mohammed qu ##dah , a professor of islamic law at the university of jordan , who
[CLS] now in his 60s , ot ##hman and fellow villagers in the town of wan ##a , 22 miles - ##lr ##b ##- 35 ##km - ##rr ##b ##- north ##- ##ea ##st of mo ##sul , still depend on the dam as a vital source of water and irrigation for his crops . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` life is water , ' ##' said ot ##hman , who is proud of his kurdish roots , adding that his ancestors have lived in wan ##a for the last 800 years . [SEP] [CLS] sitting on an earth mound on the edge of his field , and puff ##ing on a cigarette , he said his family had been up ##ro ##oted from the town just once , when militants from the so ##- ##cal ##led islamic state - ##lr ##b ##- is - ##rr ##b ##- captured mo ##sul dam and wan ##a in august 2014 . [SEP] [CLS] is ex ##tre ##mist ##s were forced to retreat from the dam after 11 days , and from a number of surrounding villages , following us ##- ##led air strikes and a ground offensive by kurdish pe ##sh ##mer ##ga forces . [SEP] [CLS] dressed in traditional kurdish clothes and speaking in broken arabic , ot ##hman said : ` ##` we ca n ##' ##t imagine what life would be like if we had to leave our houses again this time under the threat of the potential collapse of the dam . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] inaugurated in 1984 during the era of saddam hussein , the dam today is falling into disrepair as a result of neglect over the past 18 months after the ku ##rds wr ##ested it back from is . [SEP] [CLS] budget short ##falls due to the slump in oil prices and political rivalry between the central government in baghdad and the regional government of the semi ##- ##au ##ton ##omo ##us iraq kurdistan have hampered urgently needed repairs . [SEP] [CLS] there is also a desperate shortage of workers . [SEP] [CLS] half the workforce has left the dam for other jobs on account of not being paid for up to five months . [SEP] [CLS] we had special access inside the dam ' ##s labyrinth of tunnels to see the urgent problems first ##- ##hand . [SEP] [CLS] outdated machinery is still being used to try to stab ##ilis ##e the dam ' ##s foundations . [SEP] [CLS] the dam ' ##s deputy director , mo ##hs ##en ya ##q ##ou ##b , showed us samples of soil that had suffered erosion . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` these black parts are the treated cement used to in ##ject into the holes and fractures created by the water that constantly eats away at the unstable foundation of the dam , ' ##' he said .

[CLS] not far away , in brooklyn bridge park , where once derelict piers have been converted into outdoor sports centres , the soccer pitches are usually more crowded than the basketball courts . [SEP] [CLS] a short walk down the hill , an archway under the manhattan bridge last summer hosted one of new york ' ##s world cup ` ##` viewing parties ' ##' , where thousands gathered to watch games , and not just those involving the american national team . [SEP] [CLS] so it seemed inc ##ong ##ru ##ous to stand in front of the courthouse last week , fielding questions from presenters in london about why a country with no interest in football had suddenly assumed the role of global policeman of the global game . [SEP] [CLS] that line of inquiry seemed about a decade out of date . [SEP] [CLS] it is akin to the blanket condemnation that americans lack a sense of humour or irony - this in the land of jon stewart , tina fey , stephen colbert , chris rock , amy poe ##hler , jerry se ##in ##feld , david letterman and garry shan ##dling . [SEP] [CLS] true , football , or soccer as it is known here , is not as central to american as it is to european , african or south and central american life . [SEP] [CLS] up until recently , the game has been un ##lov ##ed by the major us television networks , which have long be ##mo ##ane ##d the lack of breaks in play , the pau ##city of goals and the g ##lu ##t of draws .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` in our family , frank is remembered as a big personality who was completely dedicated to his work , but who would take centre stage at family gatherings at which he would invariably arrive at least an hour late ' ##' , she said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` he was great company , had a mischievous streak and a low opinion of those in authority - and in particular , politicians ! ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] this lack of respect for authority was a common theme and is the reason , some believe , that he has not received the credit in the uk that his achievements deserve . [SEP] [CLS] while pan ##tri ##dge would go on to save many lives because of his invention - including the high ##- ##pro ##fi ##le case of former footballer fabric ##e mu ##am ##ba , who collapsed on the pitch in 2012 and was saved by a portable def ##ib ##rill ##ator - his early life was somewhat troubled . [SEP] [CLS] he grew up on a farm on the outskirts of hillsborough , county down , his father died when he was 10 and he was expelled from school several times . [SEP] [CLS] but he completed his secondary education at friends school , li ##sb ##urn , and went on to study medicine at queen ' ##s university , belfast , qualifying in 1939 . [SEP] [CLS] when world war two broke out , he was posted to the far east as medical officer to an infantry battalion . [SEP] [CLS] he was captured during the fall of singapore in 1942 and , as a prisoner of war , spent much of his time as a slave labour ##er on the burma railway . [SEP] [CLS] pan ##tri ##dge survived the usually fatal cardiac be ##ri ##ber ##i - where protein deficiency damages the heart - which may have sparked his interest in heart disease . [SEP] [CLS] he was later awarded the military cross for his service , with the citation reading : ` ##` this officer worked un ##cea ##sing ##ly under the most adverse conditions of continuous bombing and shell ##ing and was an inspiring example to all with whom he came into contact .

[CLS] education select committee chairman neil carmichael said parents would be ` ##` wondering what to do ' ##' after friday ' ##s ruling , and would need clarity . [SEP] [CLS] the high court concluded jon platt had no case to answer because his daughter had attended school regularly overall . [SEP] [CLS] the government has said it will now consider making alterations to the law . [SEP] [CLS] what are the rules on holidays ? [SEP] [CLS] the isle of wight council had asked the high court to clarify whether a seven ##- ##day absence amounted to a child failing to attend regularly after mr platt , 44 , took his daughter on holiday , despite her school refusing permission for the trip . [SEP] [CLS] the court backed magistrates who had ruled mr platt , had no case to answer . [SEP] [CLS] speaking to bbc radio four ' ##s today programme , mr carmichael said : ` ##` i certainly think we need a period of reflection on this matter because this ruling causes a huge amount of confusion . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` instead of confusion we need clarity - clarity for parents and clarity for the schools , because people will be wondering what to do next given the scale of the change . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] since 2013 , tough ##er government regulations have meant head teachers can grant leave of absence to pupils during term time only in ` ##` exceptional circumstances ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] shadow schools minister nic da ##kin told today the previous rules , which allowed head teachers to grant leave for up to 10 days under ` ##` special circumstances ' ##' , had been ` ##` working effectively ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] but mr carmichael said the problem with that policy was in defining what counted as ` ##` special circumstances ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` you ' ##d have to be very careful about defining what you think is a special circumstance , ' ##' he said . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` the government will have to think very carefully about this because what we do n ##' ##t want is the special circumstance happens to be ` there ' ##s a cheap holiday and we ' ##d like to go ' . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] rather than rev ##ert ##ing to the previous system , which he argued could lead to classroom disruption because of families taking children on cheaper holidays , mr carmichael suggested that term times could be ` ##` more flexible ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] he said this was a suggestion he would be making to the education select committee when it considers the issue . [SEP] [CLS] mr da ##kin said the ruling was the ` ##` worst of both worlds ' ##' because it left uncertainty for both teachers and parents . [SEP] [CLS] he criticised the decision to change the rules
[CLS] hey ##drich - one of the architects of the final solution when he was governor of occupied bohemia - was assassinated by british ##- ##train ##ed czech and slovak troops in may 1942 . [SEP] [CLS] it was an operation which was so au ##da ##cious in its planning and execution that it inspired john martin from mold , flint ##shire , to research the topic for more than 40 years .

[SEP] [CLS] it stars actors ci ##lli ##an murphy and fifty shades of grey star jamie do ##rna ##n who portrays a czech resistance fighter . [SEP] [CLS] mr martin , who is an extra in the film , said : ` ##` not many people have heard of ant ##hr ##op ##oid , partly because it was earlier on in the war , and partly because afterwards britain ' ##s role was played down by the soviets . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` it took me until after the fall of the iron curtain to be able to get into prague and properly investigate what happened . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] born in 1904 , rein ##hard hey ##drich was a decorated german naval officer in the weimar republic . [SEP] [CLS] during the rise of the nazis he progressed quickly to head several branches of the nazi secret police , including the gestapo and sd , and was a key figure in both ` the night of the long knives ' and ` kris ##tal ##ln ##ach ##t ' . [SEP] [CLS] as nazi head in occupied czechoslovakia , he was instructed to improve the productivity of the region ' ##s flag ##ging munitions and automobile factories . [SEP] [CLS] it was a role which he performed so successfully that the allies determined he must be removed . [SEP] [CLS] mr martin said : ` ##` before hey ##drich ' ##s appointment the czech resistance had been quite successful in reducing productivity by as much as a third through go ##- ##slow ##s . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` hey ##drich introduced a policy he called ` sugar and whip ' , whereby those who cooperate ##d gained extra rations and clothing , whilst those who did n ##' ##t were kidnapped , tortured and killed .

[SEP] [CLS] he took 9 ##, ##6 ##22 votes with 62 ##. ##6 % of support among party members . [SEP] [CLS] the am for north wales sits as an independent in the sen ##edd after falling out with the uk ##ip assembly group leader neil hamilton . [SEP] [CLS] uk ##ip ' ##s ruling national executive committee had earlier agreed to hold a ballot of welsh members on whether mr gill should continue to be both an am and an me ##p . [SEP] [CLS] but mr gill claimed the new leader did not want the ballot to happen . [SEP] [CLS] he told bbc wales : ` ##` i ' ##ve spoken to paul about this and paul tells me he does n ##' ##t want a ballot to go ahead .

[SEP] [CLS] ` ##` now if nigel can speak to those people then without a doubt paul nut ##tal ##l from boot ##le on mer ##sey ##side absolutely can and will . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] mr hamilton said : ` ##` i think paul nut ##tal ##l has a very good chance of appealing very widely to ex ##- ##lab ##our voters ... because he comes from an authentic working ##- ##class background in liverpool .

[SEP] [CLS] she was asked about messages she exchanged with mr johnson on the day of the incident with the girl , and she admitted she suspected him of being un ##fa ##ith ##ful but had no ` ##` hard and fast evidence ' ##' .

[CLS] ` ##` i have been asked in my younger years to consider joining , and i just never felt ready or prepared , ' ##' said ms se ##ifer ##t , who started working as a model at the age of 14 and later worked as a television presenter . [SEP] [CLS] but the moment finally arrived in 2009 , after she had finished a nursing degree in new york . [SEP] [CLS] at the age of 25 - the limit for most pageant ##s - time was running out . [SEP] [CLS] ms se ##ifer ##t trained for over a month at a so ##- ##cal ##led beauty camp , setting her sights on representing the philippines at the miss universe competition . [SEP] [CLS] but she said pageant organise ##rs disqualified her days before the finals over bikini photos published in a men ' ##s magazine . [SEP] [CLS] und ##au ##nted , she decided to take part in another national pageant weeks later . [SEP] [CLS] not only did she win the national miss earth title , she went on to compete in the international pageant , where she was crowned runner ##- ##up out of 80 competitors from all over the world . [SEP] [CLS] beauty pageant ##s have been popular in the philippines since they were brought to the country by the american colonial government in the first half of the 20th century , says jose wendell cap ##ili , an academic at the university of the philippines in the capital , manila . [SEP] [CLS] opposition from feminist ##s , if there is any , is muted . [SEP] [CLS] the recent successes of candidates in international competitions have heightened interest even further . [SEP] [CLS] mr cap ##ili , who wrote a book about philippine pageant ##s , says that as a result , pageant ##s have become more competitive . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` in the old days , an un ##train ##ed candidate may end up winning a title either because she is a great beauty or is someone from a pe ##di ##gree ##d family , ' ##' he said .

[CLS] whether or not he is on the formal menu , mr snow ##den will certainly colour their conversation and the press conference that follows . [SEP] [CLS] ms mer ##kel ' ##s trip to the us is markedly different in tone and substance from her last visit to washington in june 2011 . [SEP] [CLS] back then , there was a state dinner during which mr obama presented her the medal of freedom . [SEP] [CLS] he talked of a productive partnership with ms mer ##kel , one of the few world leaders with whom he has established a warm connection . [SEP] [CLS] she referred to him more than once as ` ##` dear barack ' ##' . [SEP] [CLS] this week ' ##s meeting is much shorter and will be all business . [SEP] [CLS] three years ago , the leaders spent considerable time talking about the arab spring in tunisia , egypt , libya and syria , and g ##8 efforts to support those democratic transitions . [SEP] [CLS] they reiterated the desire to achieve negotiated settlements to the ve ##xing challenges of the iranian nuclear programme . [SEP] [CLS] they discussed the pending change in military strategy in afghanistan and the need to overcome trade barriers and accelerate economic growth . [SEP] [CLS] three years later , the policy outlook is vastly different , although thankfully not all bad . [SEP] [CLS] for example , not only are negotiations with iran under way , there is a decent chance they will be successful . [SEP] [CLS] the war in afghanistan is winding down . [SEP] [CLS] the afghan presidential election is going surprisingly well . [SEP] [CLS] whoever replaces president hamid ka ##rza ##i is likely to agree to a follow ##- ##on nato mission there . [SEP] [CLS] the most urgent regional transformation is not the middle east , where an arab spring has , with the exception of tunisia , become a humanitarian nightmare , but ukraine , where russian president vladimir putin has already overseen the red ##ra ##wing of the european map and may be ag ##itating for more . [SEP] [CLS] there is no longer a g ##8 , but a g ##7 , trying to co ##- ##ord ##inate sanctions that impose costs on mr putin while mini ##mis ##ing the impact on the european economy , not as easy a task as some suggest . [SEP] [CLS] the costs to mr putin are increasing , even if the ramp is not as steep as pun ##dit ##s and even some government officials on this side of the atlantic would prefer . [SEP] [CLS] this week the us imposed a new round of sanctions on russia ' ##s high tech sector and the eu quickly followed suit . [SEP] [CLS] such co ##- ##ord ##ination is important since the lift over time will be much heavier in europe . [SEP] [CLS] its level of integration with russia exceeds that

[SEP] [CLS] museum scientist amore ##t whitaker is one of just three forensic en ##tom ##ologists in the uk who regularly works with the police to determine the time of death of a corpse . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` as soon as a person dies , their body starts to deco ##mp ##ose and they give off specific o ##dou ##rs . [SEP] [CLS] these different chemical signals are very very attractive to insects . [SEP] [CLS] and in the in ##ital stages it ' ##s especially blow ##flies . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` so when someone dies , fairly soon , it could be within minutes blow ##flies are attracted to the body and they will start laying eggs immediately . [SEP] [CLS] these will hatch into larvae or mag ##go ##ts and the developmental cycle will continue . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` you get a lot of male blow ##flies hanging around , sitting on plants around the body , waiting for suitable female mates . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] and it is this cycle of life and death that is critical in helping the police when they are uncertain of the timing of someone ' ##s death . [SEP] [CLS] by understanding the ` ##` succession ' ##' rates or the speed of growth of flies , from an egg to the la ##rval then adult stage she and her colleagues can determine the likely time that person died .

[SEP] [CLS] by breeding them in ` ##` captivity ' ##' under different temperature conditions they can get more accurate information about the timing of their growth and so the process of death . [SEP] [CLS] the accuracy of that timing depends partly on how long the body has been deco ##mp ##osing .

[SEP] [CLS] some texans have developed a habit of using the chilean flag in text messages and on social media as a sign of national pride .

[CLS] yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals .

[SEP] [CLS] and having worked in remote settings , dr williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be . [SEP] [CLS] in zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable main ##s power supply . [SEP] [CLS] so the doctors set themselves the challenge of in ##venting essential kit for the doctor ' ##s bag on a budget . [SEP] [CLS] and after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools , they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives . [SEP] [CLS] the shake ##rs ##cope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people ' ##s eyes , ears and throat ##s . [SEP] [CLS] but unlike regular devices it does not need batteries . [SEP] [CLS] dr patrick fin ##lay , of the institution of mechanical engineers said : ` ##` according to the world health organisation , 95 % of medical devices fail to work in developing countries . [SEP] [CLS] often designers in the west do n ##' ##t understand the conditions elsewhere . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` this type of invention is very important . [SEP] [CLS] with these scope ##s you would normally need three different instruments for each examination , each one requiring batteries . [SEP] [CLS] for low income countries this is a joke . ' ##' [SEP] [CLS] at the core of the shake ##rs ##cope is a powerful move ##able magnet , surrounded by a coil of wire . [SEP] [CLS] as noted by michael far ##aday in 1831 , as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induce ##s an electric current in the coil . [SEP] [CLS] and shaking the shake ##rs ##cope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes .

[CLS] as we walked in , three or four people were waiting around a table - but which one , i wondered , was the father of bit ##co ##in ? [SEP] [CLS] then i realised that one man was staring intensely at a very chunk ##y laptop - this was dr craig wright . [SEP] [CLS] he carried on working , apparently unaware that we had entered the room . [SEP] [CLS] once we had been introduced he gradually warmed up - especially when it came to performing the demonstration that showed that he did have access to the crypt ##ographic keys used by sato ##shi when he made the first bit ##co ##in transaction in 2009 . [SEP] [CLS] we had arrived wondering just how convincing a case would be made that the almost mythical creator of bit ##co ##in was at last stepping out of the shadows . [SEP] [CLS] what we saw seemed impressive - though it would need a far higher level of expertise than we possess to be certain . [SEP] [CLS] but jon mat ##onis , a senior figure in the bit ##co ##in world , was in the room watching , having had his own demonstration some time before . [SEP] [CLS] and the news that gavin andres ##en , chief scientist at the bit ##co ##in foundation , was also convinced provided more re ##ass ##urance . [SEP] [CLS] now craig wright has published his evidence on his blog , it will be examined in minute detail for any chin ##k in his case . [SEP] [CLS] but put aside the question of whether you believe him or not - and he told me he did n ##' ##t care either way - there were still plenty of questions we wanted to put to the fascinating , if somewhat prick ##ly dr wright . [SEP] [CLS] why keep his secret so long ? [SEP] [CLS] what about that run ##- ##in with the australian tax authorities ? [SEP] [CLS] and is he fabulous ##ly rich , with a huge stock of bit ##co ##in ? [SEP] [CLS] at our first meeting - without a television camera - we roam ##ed freely over all sorts of territory . [SEP] [CLS] we learned that he ran a substantial business in london , employing quite a few people here in what seemed to be some kind of bit ##co ##in trading and consultancy operation . [SEP] [CLS] we challenged him about that tax investigation - he conceded that there was what he called an ` ##` audit ' ##' underway in australia but insisted that this was mainly due to the tax authorities there not really understanding bit ##co ##in .

[CLS] joshua , 27 , and ukraine ' ##s k ##lit ##sch ##ko , 40 , had agreed terms on a world heavyweight title bout . [SEP] [CLS] but k ##lit ##sch ##ko is reportedly reluctant to fight without at least one of the wb ##a or wb ##o titles on the line . [SEP] [CLS] hear ##n said he was ` ##` crossing fingers ' ##' that k ##lit ##sch ##ko took the fight . [SEP] [CLS] both the wb ##a and wb ##o will need to san ##ction the bout for their respective belts to be made available , but are yet to do so . [SEP] [CLS] britain ' ##s tyson fury beat k ##lit ##sch ##ko last november to win the wb ##a , ib ##f and wb ##o titles , before being stripped of the ib ##f title for failing to fight the mandatory challenger . [SEP] [CLS] britain ' ##s joshua then beat american charles martin to win the ib ##f belt in april . [SEP] [CLS] last week , fury , 28 , relinquished his wb ##a and wb ##o belts and his boxing licence was then suspended . [SEP] [CLS] the wb ##c belt is held by american de ##ont ##ay wilder . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` we are beginning discussions with other opponents now while crossing our fingers that k ##lit ##sch ##ko takes the fight , regardless of how many belts are on the line , ' ##' hear ##n told sky sports . [SEP] [CLS] another option for k ##lit ##sch ##ko would be to fight new zealand ##er joseph parker for the wb ##o belt in germany . [SEP] [CLS] ` ##` in an ideal world , there would be as many belts as possible on the line , but i hope he takes up the challenge rather than a soft touch in germany , ' ##' added hear ##n .
